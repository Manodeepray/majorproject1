          "a brief introduction to artificial intelligence what is ai and how is it going to shape the future by dibbyo saha, undergraduate student, computer science, ryerson university what is artificial intelligence? imag e by gerd altmann from pixabay generally speaking, artificial intelligence is a computing concept that helps a machine think and solve complex problems as we humans do with our intelligence. for example, we perform a task, make mistakes and learn from our mistakes (at least the wise ones of us do!). likewise, an ai or artificial intelligence is supposed to work on a problem, make some mistakes in solving the problem and learn from the problems in a self-correcting manner as a part of its self-improvement. or in other words, think of this like playing a game of chess. every bad move you make reduces your chances of winning the game. so, every time you lose against your friend, you try remembering the moves you made which you shouldnt have and apply that knowledge in your next game and so on. eventually, you get better and your precision, or in this case probability of winning or solving a problem",
          "complicated and intuitive sense of thinking and problem-solving abilities of the human mind. a brief history of ai the concept of artificial intelligence is not as modern as we think it is. this traces back to as early as 1950 when alan turing invented the turing test. then the first chatbot computer program, eliza, was created in the 1960s. [1] ibm deep blue was a chess computer made in 1977 beat a world chess champion in two out of six games, one won by the champion and the other three games were draw. [2] in 2011, siri was announced as a digital assistant by apple. [3] elon musk and some others founded openai in 2015. [4][5] artificial intelligence vs machine learning vs deep learning imag e by gerd altmann from pixabay up until now in this article we were discussing about artificial intelligence as a process that is going to help machines achieve a humanlike mental behaviour. ai is a vast and growing field which also includes a lot more subfields like machine learning and deep learning and so on. machine learning is in a nutshell the concept of computers learning to improve their predictions and creativity to resemble a humanlike thinking process using algorithms. machine learning involves a number of learning processes such as: supervised learning : supervised learning is a process where our machines are designed to learn with the feeding of labelled data. in this process our machine",
          "sour ce:h ttp: da tasciencecen tral.com deep learning, on the other hand is the concept of computers simulating the process a human brain takes to analyze, think and learn. the deep learning process involves something called a neural network as a part of the thinking process for an ai. it takes an enormous amount of data to train deep learning and a considerably powerful computing device for such computation methods. ai at work today phot o by dan seif ert the v erge the most common examples of uses of artificial intelligence can be found today in smart personal assistants like apples siri and amazons alexa. people interact with these devices to command them on a daily basis and these devices use the commands as a part of their dataset to learn from. another known example of artificial intelligence is the use of algorithms in netflix. netflix provides very much accurate and relevant suggestions of movies, tv series from our data which is created every time we stream or click on something in netflix. as the dataset for these systems grows, their accuracy and precision increase as well. artificial"

          "what is trans fat? the simplest description of trans fat, or trans fatty acid, is solidified oil . the liquid oil solidifies because of changes in the way fatty acids are held together. the solidification occurs through natural bacterial action in the stomach of ruminant animals sheep, cows, goats and camels or by partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils during food manufacturing. naturally occurring trans fats are found in the meat, milk and dairy products of ruminants. industrially produced trans fats result from the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (vegetable oils) to create semi-solid, easy-to- spread fats, such as margarine and other fats used in food manufacturing, baking and frying. heating oils at very high temperatures also causes partial hydrogenation, so fried foods are potentially important sources of trans fat in the diet. industrial hydrogenation of vegetable oils increases their stability and solidity, thus increasing the shelf life of the final product while decreasing the need for its refrigeration. hydrogenated oils became popular also because they give a desirable texture and taste to food.harmful effects of trans fats not all that glitters is gold eating trans fat increases the risk of developing heart disease and stroke. globally, trans fats are estimated to contribute to more than 500 000 deaths from cardiovascular disease every year. the mechanism by which they increase cardiovascular disease risk is not clear, but one hypothesis is that they interfere with the metabolism of essential fatty acids, causing increased levels of the so-called bad cholesterol and reduced levels of the good cholesterol. the bad cholesterol is what clogs up the arteries and leads to cardiovascular disease. trans fats are also associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism remains unclear, and results from studies are conflicting.food is goodknow it, and enjoy it!",

          "sources and how to limit the intake of trans fat the contribution of naturally occurring trans fats to total consumption is minimal. industrially produced trans fats are the main source of dietary consumption in margarine, deep- fried foods, fast foods and cakes, pastries and chocolates. tips to limit trans fat intake include:about saturated fats saturated fats come mainly from meat and dairy products fatty beef, pork, lamb, lard, butter, ghee, cream and cheese. plant sources of saturated fat are palm and coconut oils. saturated fats, like trans fats, increase levels of the bad cholesterol in the blood and therefore increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. avoid foods that contain industrial trans fats cakes, cookies and desserts (often made with margarine or shortening); pizza; processed and fatty meats (sausages, hot dogs, bacon, ribs); and ice cream. read food labels and avoiding foods that contain trans fat or partially hydrogenated oil. use monounsaturated fat (such as olive oil) and polyunsaturated fat (soybean, corn and sunflower oil) in recipes that call for fat. eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein and dairy products. avoid the use of reheated oil when cooking and frying foods."

          "development of critical social philosophy is spinoza. his significance is established by the clarity with which he exposes the political interests that lie behind metaphysical defenses of established social hierarchies. by exposing these politi cal interests spinoza opens up the possibility of a social philosophy focused on the way in which human power is organized by social institutions. by retaining the concepts of classical metaphysics, however, spinoza at the same time avoids the dangers (represented by hobbes) on collapsing his social philosophy into a mechanical empiricist th eory of the cunning exploitation of human nature. in order to understand his importan ce for social philosophy it is important to first survey briefly his metaphysics. spinozas essential argument, that g od and nature are synonymous, was profoundly controversial, both in amsterdam when he first propounded it, and almost a century later, in germany, when key figures of the german enlightenment like lessing took it up. spinoza was expelled from the city of am sterdam because the elders of the jewish community feared reprisals lest his purportedly atheistic doctrine spread. it was also this supposed atheism that generated inte rest in his work in eighteenth century germany. here i am not interested in whet her spinozas doctrines lead to atheism; indeed, beyond necessary prefatory comments th e analysis is not concerned with his conception of god. what does concern th e present purposes is the new form of relationship between human and divine life th at spinozas arguments make possible. hence i will focus upon this relationship, and in particular upon its human side. in the tradition of speculative thinking from wh ich spinoza proceeds the category of substance designated being of the highest t ype. to take a simple example, if we observe walking then there must be a being that",

          "what is a healthy diet? a healthy diet is one that provides the body with essential nutrition; that is, adequate energy, nutrients and fluids to maintain and regulate body functions, support growth, repair tissue and prevent disease. in other words, it prevents nutritional deficiencies as well as the excesses that lead to weight gain and obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, gout and other diet-related health problems. a healthy diet typically consists of natural, fresh, minimally processed foods, as opposed to (highly) processed foods that are low in fibre and contain large amounts of salt, fats, free sugars and other components that have harmful health effects. a healthy diet is also a safe diet. this means food free of biological and chemical contaminants. it is important to remember that ingredients added to food during processing salt, sugar, fat, preservatives if excessive, also pose health risks. our food preferences food preferences have a small element of genetic predisposition. the rest is learned and acquired right from the womb. as the foetus swallows amniotic fluid, it becomes accustomed to the tastes of the food that the mother eats. right from birth, infants show aversion to bitter and acid tastes and preference for sweet tastes. it is believed that mother nature thus equips her children with an affinity to what is nourishing (sugary foods) and an aversion to what may be poisonous (bitter foods). early child feeding and the circumstances of exposure to various tastes train each of us to like or dislike certain tastes. it is probable that the habit of giving young children candies when they cry establishes a sub-conscious association of sweet things with love and comfort. by the same token, force-feeding less desirable-tasting foods leaves a lifelong aversion to those tastes. therefore, preference for a healthy",
          "food for the body and the mind food is good! knowing what it does for the body and the mind is key to making the right choices and enjoying the best of it. eating is necessary to provide energy for the bodys functions, and nutrients to repair and build tissue, prevent sickness and help the body heal from illness. knowledge of what food does for the body and mind empowers you to choose the right type, quality and quantity of food thats the art. foods, nutrients and their functions - carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. we get them from roots, tubers, grains, sugar, fruits, legumes, dairy products and vegetables. - fats and oils are concentrated forms of energy, but they also help the absorption of vitamins, support cell membrane health and maintain the immune system. - protein foods perform the main body-building and repair functions as well as being sources of energy in the absence of carbohydrates. the best protein sources are animal foods meat, poultry, fish, eggs, insects and dairy products. we also get protein from such plant sources as beans, peas, nuts, cereals and derived products. - vitamins and minerals collectively are called micronutrients because the body needs them in small quantities. but they are crucial for regulating tissue growth and vital body functions, including the preservation of cell integrity. - and then there is water. water is life. it makes up 60 of our bodies and is the medium for all vital body functions. it helps to keep the balance between the acidic and alkaline substances that would otherwise destroy cells. humans cannot survive more than a few days without water. t o eat is a necessity; to eat intelligently is an art franois de la rochefoucauld, philosopher.food is goodknow it, and",

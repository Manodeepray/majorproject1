A comprehensive API for building and querying a knowledge base from unstructured documents.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Upload Documents:** Use the `/upload` endpoint to submit your files (.txt, .pdf, etc.). The server will process them in the background to build a searchable vector index.
2.  **Query the Knowledge Base:** Once processing is complete, use the `/query` or `/deepquery` endpoint to ask questions. The API will retrieve relevant information and generate a concise answer.

# NOTE
- make sure to cut and paste all the files from `data_warehouse` --> uploaded ..
- then delete all the data in the `database/` except `data_warehouse`
- then run `python3 -m scr.Datacolectionpipe` to properly restart the ingestion pipeline .. path issue 


# ISSUES
- no chat function for querying/deep querying... i.e remove query from side panel to centre for continuous conversation
- discover button not working i,e new files not showing 
- remove timeout from buttons or extend it (from generate faq , quiz ,deep query, etc etc...)..-> reason : since the endpoints take too long to generate any task  
- fix add note button to save note for sessions 

# IMPROVEMENT
- add audio api to talk to it
- make the webapp less bulky
- add name to webapp instead of STUDIIO
- add analytics

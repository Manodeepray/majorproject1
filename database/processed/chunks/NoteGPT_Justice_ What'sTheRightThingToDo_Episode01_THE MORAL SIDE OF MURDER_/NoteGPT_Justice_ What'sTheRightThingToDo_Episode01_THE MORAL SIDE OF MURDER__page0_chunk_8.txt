would yank out the organs, why? i'd actually like to explore slightly alternate possibility of just taking the one of the five he needs an organ who dies first and using their four healthy organs to save the other four 00:12:50 that's a pretty good idea. that's a great idea except for the fact that you just wrecked the philosophical point. let's step back from these stories and these arguments to notice a couple of things about the way the arguments have began to unfold. certain moral principles have already begun to emerge from the discussions we've had and let's consider what those moral principles look like the first moral principle that emerged from the discussion said that the right thing to do the moral thing to do 00:13:39 depends on the consequences that will result from your action at the end of the day better that five should live even if one must die. that's an example of consequentialist moral reasoning. consequentialist moral reasoning locates morality in the consequences of an act. in the state of the world that will result from the thing you do but then we went a little further, we considered those other cases and people weren't so sure about consequentialist moral reasoning when people hesitated to push the fat man 00:14:24 over the bridge or to yank out the organs of the innocent patient people gestured towards reasons having to do with the intrinsic quality of the act itself. consequences be what they may. people were reluctant people thought it was just wrong categorically wrong to kill a person an innocent person even for the sake of saving five lives, at least these people thought that in the second version of each story we reconsidered so this points a second categorical way of thinking

any case if i'm murdering you to advance my status, that's murder and i think that we should look at all 00:49:25 of that in the same light. instead of criminalizing certain activities and making certain things seem more violent and savage when in that same case it's all the same act and mentality that goes into the murder, a necessity to feed their families. suppose there weren't three, supposed there were thirty, three hundred, one life to save three hundred or in more time, three thousand or suppose the stakes were even bigger. suppose the stakes were even bigger i think it's still the same deal. do you think bentham was wrong to say the right thing to do 00:49:58 is to add up the collected happiness, you think he's wrong about that? i don't think he is wrong, but i think murder is murder in any case. well then bentham has to be wrong if you're right he's wrong. okay then he's wrong. alright thank you, well done. alright, let's step back from this discussion and notice how many objections have we heard to what they did. we heard some defenses of what they did the defense has had to do with necessity the dire circumstance and, implicitly at least, the idea that numbers matter 00:50:36 and not only numbers matter but the wider effects matter their families back home, their dependents parker was an orphan, no one would miss him. so if you add up if you tried to calculate the balance of happiness and suffering you might have a case for saying what they did was the right thing then we heard at least three different types of objections, we heard an objection that's said what they did was categorically wrong, right here at the end

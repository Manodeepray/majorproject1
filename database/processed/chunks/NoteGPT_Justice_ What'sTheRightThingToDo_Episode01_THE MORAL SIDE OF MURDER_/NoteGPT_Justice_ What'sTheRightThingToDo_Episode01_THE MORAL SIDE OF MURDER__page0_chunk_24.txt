his consent would it be all right do you think or not? no, it still wouldn't be right. tell us why wouldn't be all right. first of all, cannibalism, i believe is morally incorrect so you shouldnt be eating a human anyway. so cannibalism is morally objectionable outside so then even in the scenario of waiting until someone died still it would be objectionable. 00:42:27 yes, to me personally i feel like of it all depends on one's personal morals, like we can't just, like this is just my opinion of course other people are going to disagree. well let's see, let's hear what their disagreements are and then we'll see if they have reasons that can persuade you or not. let's try that let's now is there someone who can explain, those of you who are tempted by consent can you explain why consent makes such a moral difference, what about the lottery idea does that count as consent. remember at the beginning 00:43:09 dudley proposed a lottery suppose that they had agreed to a lottery then how many would then say it was all right. say there was a lottery, cabin boy lost, and the rest of the story unfolded. how many people would say it's morally permissible? so the numbers are rising if we add a lottery, let's hear from one of you for whom the lottery would make a moral difference why would it? i think the essential element, in my mind that makes it a crime is the idea that they decided at some point that their lives were more important than his, and that 00:43:54 i mean that's kind of the basis for really any crime right? it's like my needs, my desire is a more important than yours and mine take precedent and

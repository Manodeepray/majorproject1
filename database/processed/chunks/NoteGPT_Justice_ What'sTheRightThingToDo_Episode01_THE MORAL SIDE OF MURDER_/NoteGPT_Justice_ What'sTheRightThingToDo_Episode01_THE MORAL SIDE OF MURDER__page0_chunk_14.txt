what you gotta do. pretty much, if you've been going nineteen days without any food someone has to take the sacrifice, someone has to make the sacrifice and people can survive. alright that's good, what's your name? marcus. marcus, what do you say to marcus? last time we started out last time with some stores with some moral dilemmas about trolley cars and about doctors and healthy patients vulnerable to being victims of organ transplantation we noticed two things about the arguments we had one had to do with the way we were arguing 00:25:11 it began with our judgments in particular cases we tried to articulate the reasons or the principles lying behind our judgments and then confronted with a new case we found ourselves re-examining those principles revising each in the light of the other and we noticed the built-in pressure to try to bring into alignment our judgments about particular cases and the principles we would endorse on reflection we also noticed something about the substance of the arguments that emerged from the discussion. 00:25:55 we noticed that sometimes we were tempted to locate the morality of an act in the consequences in the results, in the state of the world that it brought about. we called is consequentialist moral reason. but we also noticed that in some cases we weren't swayed only by the results sometimes, many of us felt, that not just consequences but also the intrinsic quality or character of the act matters morally. some people argued that there are certain things that are just categorically wrong even if they bring about 00:26:43 a good result even if they save five people at the cost of one life. so we contrasted consequentialist moral principles with categorical ones. today and in the next few days

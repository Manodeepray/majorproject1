spot the sugar!3 before you pass the sugar, please free sugars, which include the sugar added to food during processing, while cooking and at the table and the sugars occurring naturally in honey, fruit juices and concentrates, should contribute less than 10 of our daily energy intake. this is equivalent to 50 grams (about 12 teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight. however, there are additional health benefits (such as reducing the incidence of tooth decay) if the total daily intake of free sugars is kept to six teaspoons or fewer. can you spot the sugar? it is easy to know and to control how much sugar is added to your food during home cooking and at the table, but how about the sugar in processed foods? do you know the secret ingredient that makes ketchup so popular with children? sugar! and there is sugar in the most unlikely foods. therefore, make a habit of looking at the label (if it is legible!) on the foods you put into your shopping basket.below are some examples of labels you may find on food packaging. declaration of the ingredients in processed foods (or better still, the content of energy and key nutrients per 100 grams or 100 millilitres) should be a minimum labelling requirement so that consumers can tell how much sugar is contained in the food they purchase. but not all countries in the african region have or enforce the necessary regulations in line with this requirement. and even where nutrients are declared, consumer education may be needed to inculcate the effective use of the available labelling information. food is goodknow it, and enjoy it! 6 tsp or fewer per day baby food (30.2 sugar)ketchup (22.7 sugar) sweet-flavoured popcorn (65.7 sugar)fruit drink from concentrate (14.2 sugar)

of plant extracts and chemically synthesized alternatives to sugar. they impart a sweet taste to food but have lower (or no) calorie content, compared with sugar. in fact, their original use was to help reduce calorie intake and control weight gain. the brain does not distinguish sweetness from sugar versus non-sugar sweeteners. thus, the use of artificial sweeteners may be especially problematic in children because being exposed to very sweet tastes (artificial or natural) at a young age accustoms the palate to ultra-sweet flavours. this risks decreasing the enjoyment of wholesome natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables, which are less sweet or slightly bitter. do artificial sweeteners have health benefits? are they safe? studies of health benefits have focused on artificial sweeteners (those used in diet drinks) rather than the plant extracts. artificial sweeteners are hundreds to thousands of times sweeter than sugar. evidence for their health benefits or risks is conflicting. therefore, as informed consumers, we must keep asking questions about their safety. research also shows that artificial sweeteners change the mix of bacteria in the gut and interfere with the release of insulin (the hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose). by this means, they increase the risk of glucose intolerance, which raises blood glucose and could lead to type 2 diabetes. available studies on the use of artificial weeteners and the risk of tooth decay and cancer have not been of long enough duration to provide conclusive results. surprisingly, studies of people trying to lose weight have found that the use of artificial sweeteners could lead to increased body weight! there is an interesting hypothesis of how this could happen. the sweet taste on the tongue sends a signal to the brain to prepare for the reward of caloric energy. but because the energy is not delivered,

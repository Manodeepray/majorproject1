sugars and health there is scientific evidence linking various noncommunicable diseases with excessive consumption of sugars. examples include increased risk of tooth decay, high blood pressure, unhealthy weight gain, increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, kidney disease and gout. even though the science is not conclusive regarding some of these risks, it is important that, as informed consumers, we keep asking pertinent questions. where does the sweet tooth come from? the sweet-taste preference (sweet tooth) seems to be inborn, as illustrated in experiments of newborns reactions to sugar solution versus quinine. the consumption of sweet foods in early life reinforces this predisposition. the sweet foods may be fed as part of an ordinary weaning diet or as titbits offered to console and calm a crying baby (biscuits, lollipops, etc.). as a result, the brain is trained to associate sweet things with love, comfort and happiness. this theory points to the importance of cultivating a taste for healthy foods from early childhood. in addition to early life programming, the food environment in later life can reinforce or modify the sweet-taste preference. research suggests that sugar is addictive, and the more we consume it, the more we crave it. popular experience shows that the palate can be trained to enjoy less and less sweetness in our food and drink.whats the matter with non-sugar sweeteners? non-sugar sweeteners come in forms of plant extracts and chemically synthesized alternatives to sugar. they impart a sweet taste to food but have lower (or no) calorie content, compared with sugar. in fact, their original use was to help reduce calorie intake and control weight gain. the brain does not distinguish sweetness from sugar versus non-sugar sweeteners. thus, the use of artificial sweeteners may be especially problematic in children because being exposed to very sweet

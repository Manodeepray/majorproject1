sugars and other sweet things2 what are sugars sugars are simple forms of carbohydrate, the primary supplier of the energy that fuels the bodys vital functions: breathing, blood circulation, the building and repair of tissue, the ability to move and even to think. the simplest forms of sugar contain one or two building units (molecules) and are called monosaccharides and disaccharides. monosaccharides include glucose, fructose and galactose, while the most common disaccharides are sucrose (table sugar) and lactose. complex carbohydrate forms, such as polysaccharides, are broken down into simple sugars for absorption by the body. thus, for example, starch (the most common digestible polysaccharide) in cassava, potatoes, vegetables and cereals is transformed into single glucose molecules for absorption.free sugars in the diet free sugars (as opposed to bound or intrinsic sugars) are the monosaccharides and disaccharides that occur naturally in syrups, honey and fruit juices or in processed forms that can be added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer. intrinsic sugars are present in whole fruits (fresh, dried, canned or stewed), in vegetables and in milk and dairy products. these sugars are embedded in the cells of food and tend to be digested more slowly, thus taking longer than free sugars to enter the blood stream. but when fruit is turned into juice, the fibre is crushed and sugars are released from its cells, becoming free sugars. in a healthy diet, the consumption of free sugars is kept to a minimum. free sugars non-free (intrinsic) sugars t able sugar honey malt extract, syrups and nectars coconut sugar all sugars in fruit and vegetable juices, concentrates, smoothies, pures, pastes, powders; crushed fruit and vegetable products sugars produced by fermentation in alcoholic drinks sugars in dairy-alternative drinks such as soya, rice, oat and nut-based drinks all the sugars naturally present

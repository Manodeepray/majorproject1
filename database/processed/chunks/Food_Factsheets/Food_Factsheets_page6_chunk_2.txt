for snacks instead of juice, sweet foods and confectionery (cookies and cakes). eat fresh, frozen or dried fruits. if you use canned fruits, avoid those preserved in syrup. instead of adding sugar to breakfast cereals, try sweetening with fresh fruit (like bananas) or dried fruit (like raisins and mangoes). compare food labels and choose products with low amounts of free sugars. when baking cookies, brownies or cakes, reduce the sugar in the recipe by one-third to one-half. often, you likely wont notice the difference! brush your teeth after meals.

role of sodium in the body and dietary sources sodium works in conjunction with other electrolytes (mineral elements) to regulate muscle contraction and relaxation and to control blood pressure. the electrolytes regulate the flow of fluids across cell membranes to achieve the fluid balance that is necessary for the survival and proper functioning of cells and organs. sodium is involved with potassium in operating a pump-like system that facilitates the movement of impulses through the nerves. thus, recommendations on sodium intake refer to balancing it with potassium intake. sodium occurs naturally in foods (milk, meat, shellfish, root vegetables, bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage, cucumber). fresh fruits and vegetables are rich in potassium and are thus a balanced source of sodium. iodized salt serves as a vehicle to provide iodine, which is essential for healthy brain development in a foetus and young children and for optimal mental function at all ages. the primary source of sodium in the diet is salt (sodium chloride). in some diets, more than three- quarters of salt comes from processed foods (bacon, ham, sausage, cheese, salty snacks, bread, olives, etc.), and the rest is added during cooking (salt, bouillon cubes, soy sauce, etc.) or at the table (salt, sauces and condiments).world health organization recommendations on salt consumption who recommends a total daily intake of less than 5 grams of salt (2 grams sodium) for adults; that is less than 1 teaspoon of salt (adjusted downwards for children based on their energy needs). consuming higher levels of sodium (with low levels of potassium) contributes to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. a few individuals have health conditions or may be on drug therapies that lead to lowered sodium levels or acute build-up of body water (such as patients with heart failure

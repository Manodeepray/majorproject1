is being trained by giving it access to a huge amount of data and training the machine to analyze it. for instance, the machine is given a number of images of dogs taken from many different angles with colour variations, breeds and many more diversity. so that, the machine learns to analyze data from these diverse images of dogs and the insight of machines keep increasing and soon the machine can predict if its a dog from a whole different picture which was not even a part of the labelled data set of dog images the machine was fed earlier. unsupervised learning : contrary to the supervised learning, the unsupervised learning algorithms comprises analyzing unlabelled data i.e., in this case we are training the machine to analyze and learn from a series of data, the meaning of which is not apparently comprehendible by the human eyes. the machine looks for patterns and draws conclusions on its own from the patterns of the data. important thing to remember that the dataset used in this instance is not labelled and the conclusions are drawn by the machines. reinforcement learning : reinforcement learning is a feedback dependent machine learning model. in this process the machine is given a data and made to predict what the data was. if the machine generates an inaccurate conclusion about the input data, the machine is given feedback about its incorrectness. for example, if you give the machine an image of a basketball and it identifies the basketball as a tennis ball or something else, you give a negative feedback to the machine and eventually the machine learns to identify an image of a basketball on its own when it comes across a completely different picture of a basketball.

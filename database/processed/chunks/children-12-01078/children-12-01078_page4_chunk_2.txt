effects of anime consumption on girls with asd 3.1.1. social interaction and communication difficulties in social interaction represent a core challenge for individuals with asd [ 5]. anime offers structured and predictable social exchanges that may assist girls with asd in decoding emotions, facial expressions, and interpersonal dynamics. many anime se- ries explicitly convey character emotions through exaggerated expressions and visual cues, potentially facilitating social learning. moreover, participation in anime-related communitiesparticularly within the broader anime, comics, and games (acg) subculturesmay foster a sense of belonging and offer structured opportunities for social interaction, especially for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (asd) who often experience exclusion in conventional peer settings [ 6,13]. as kuo et al., 2024 highlight, these communities serve both as spaces for personal expression and as alternative social ecosystems that reduce the pressures of normative social interaction [ 13]. this may be especially relevant for girls with asd, whoas dean et al., 2017 [ 6] noteoften engage in socially adaptive behaviors that mask difficulties, and may thus benefit from more interest- driven, less ambiguous social environments [ 6]. while gender differences are highlighted, further distinctions in engagement patterns between boys and girls, beyond frequency, remain an important area for future research. nevertheless, excessive engagement with anime may contribute to social withdrawal, particularly if it replaces real-world interactions. certain individuals with asd may find solace in fictional narratives, preferring them over the unpredictability of real-life social encounters, which could inadvertently reinforce isolation rather than enhance social competencies [7].

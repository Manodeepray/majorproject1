for instance, yan et al. conducted a study on chinese boys with asd and found that animated vehicles showing real emotional facial expressions helped improve their ability to identify emotions [ 9]. this suggests that animation, which combines movement and clear emotional cues, might be especially effective for boys with asd. similarly, eggleston et al., 2021 found that boys with asd exhibited more individualized and varied emotional responses when exposed to animation- based biofeedback compared to neurotypical children [ 10]. these results indicate that animated content might provide an accessible and engaging way for boys with asd to process and express emotions, potentially supporting their emotional development in ways traditional methods might not. 3.2.2. therapeutic applications of anime and animated narratives anime and other forms of animated storytelling have also been used therapeutically to improve social cognition and emotional skills among boys with asd. for instance, golan et al., 2010 designed animated training programs aimed at helping boys with asd to better recognize emotions, with promising results [ 15]. similarly, fletcher-watson et al., 2016 showed that animated social stories can help children with asd develop prosocial behaviors, encouraging better social interactions [ 16]. moreover, anime has been used in group therapy settings to promote identity formation and a sense of belonging, particularly in adolescent boys with asd, as documented by kuo m-h et al., 2014 [ 17]. this highlights animes potential not just as entertainment but as a culturally meaningful tool that can support emotional understanding, self-expression, and social integration in therapeutic contexts. 3.2.3. concerns about media overconsumption and social withdrawal despite these benefits, there are significant concerns about the potential negative consequences of extensive media use among boys with asd. studies conducted by mazurek et al., 2013 and chonchaiya et al., 2011 indicate that boys with asd tend to

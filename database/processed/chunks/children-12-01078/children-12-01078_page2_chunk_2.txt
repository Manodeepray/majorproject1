language, emotionally saturated narratives, and consistent character archetypes [ 3]. the unique narrative structures and aesthetic conventions of anime appear to resonate strongly with individualsparticularly children and adolescentswith asd who may be drawn to its predictable emotional cues, symbolic depth, and richly layered world-building [3]. from a developmental perspective, animes appeal may lie in its capacity to scaffold social cognition. for children with asd, who frequently struggle with decoding nonverbal cues and navigating unstructured social exchanges, the exaggerated facial expressions and clearly delineated emotional arcs characteristic of anime may facilitate improved emotion recognition and interpersonal understanding [ 69]. furthermore, participation in anime- related subcultures (e.g., fan communities, cosplay, digital forums) may offer alternative spaces for social engagement, identity formation, and creative expressiondomains that are often challenging for youth with asd in conventional social settings [10,11]. however, the increasing affinity for anime among children with asd also invites critical examination of its psychosocial implications. while engagement with animated media can support the development of empathy, narrative comprehension, and even linguistic competenceespecially when subtitles are used [ 12]it may also pose risks. excessive screen time, immersion in idealized or fantastical relationships, and a tendency toward escapism can, in some cases, reinforce patterns of social withdrawal or perpetuate unrealistic expectations about real-world interactions [10,13]. through this literature review we seek to interrogate the multifaceted role of anime consumption in the lives of boys and girls with asd, with a particular emphasis on the differential gendered experiences within this phenomenon. we aim to synthesize current findings on the cognitive, emotional, and social outcomes associated with anime engagement and to contextualize them within broader developmental psychology, media studies, and neurodiversity research discourses [ 6,7,10]. importantly, we examine the dual potential of animeas both a therapeutic and maladaptive mediumhighlighting the critical need for balanced media engagement

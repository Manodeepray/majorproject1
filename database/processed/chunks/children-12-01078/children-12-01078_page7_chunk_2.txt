role of parental involvement in supporting the social development of children with autism spectrum disorder (asd). specifically, one study examined how both dyadic (parentchild)and triadic (parentchildobject)interactions affected preschool-aged boys with asd and found that these interactions had a significant positive impact on early social skill acquisition [ 20]. this suggests that while animated content like anime can be engaging and potentially therapeutic, its effectiveness might be enhanced when paired with meaningful real-life social exchanges. 3.5. reducing screen time: a balanced approach the topic of media overuse is particularly relevant in the context of asd, where structured routines and screen-based interests often intersect. in a recent pilot study, efforts to reduce screen time while simultaneously encouraging social interaction led to improvements not only in childrens core asd-related symptoms but also in levels of parental stress [21]. 3.6. media influence and susceptibility to misinformation ongoing research into media use among individuals with asd has highlighted emerg- ing concerns about the digital environments they navigate. one recent study found that individuals with high levels of asd traits may be more vulnerable to misinformation and conspiracy theories, particularly within online platforms that mimic social media contexts [22]. 3.7. social media, friendship, and anxiety another compelling area is how anime-related digital spaces may support social con- nectivity. for adolescents with asd, online communitiesincluding anime fandomscan offer a form of social inclusion that is less demanding than face-to-face interaction. a study conducted by van schalkwyk et al., 2017 showed that adolescents with lower anxiety experienced better friendship quality when engaged with social media [23].

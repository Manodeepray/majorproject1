ai. this involved soliciting public input in the form of guidelines on ai behavior using a voting system; selecting guidelines based on the votes; manually grouping and rewriting them into principles to create a constitution; and, finally, fine-tuning and evaluating the resulting model. however, the extent to which a cai model follows a specific principle in its constitution has yet to be investigated. 2.3 llm evaluation evaluating llms growing abilities is a challenging research area [5,10,12,30]. benchmarks aimed at testing the general capabilitiesof llms, such as glue, superglue, and mmlu [ 35,69,70], suffer from data leakage and can quickly become outdated [ 18]. moreover, social bias benchmarks are often time-consuming to design, de- velop, and utilize [ 9,30,52,59]. measuring whether an llm follows a particular principle when responding is especially challenging as it requires principle-specific benchmarking methods. for instance, kundu et al . [44] trained multiple reward models to evaluate the degree to which a model follows its constitution, which requires a lot of computational resources. while zhou et al . [77] developed a benchmark for instruction-following using verifiable instructions, it is not flexible enough for evaluating principle-following. recent work has experimented with using llms to generate verifiable benchmark questions for arbitrary attributes [ 53] and to conduct natural language evaluation [ 71,72]. moreover, pairwise prefer- ence comparisons, which are key to preference-based alignment algorithms [ 50], have also recently been used as an alternative to scoring or verification-based automatic evaluation [ 48,55,76], showing high correlation with human labels [ 72]. in this paper, we use the pairwise preference paradigm to create benchmark families [65] for testing model behavior against specific principles. 2.4 psychometrics psychometrics is the field dedicated to the measurement of psycho- logical constructs, often through the development of scales that assess traits, abilities, or attitudes. traditional methods

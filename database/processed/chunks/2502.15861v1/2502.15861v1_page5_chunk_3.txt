alignment values, we found significant variation in these values across our three conversa- tional objectives, with an average alignment of 57.8 : 56.4 for the harmlessness objective, 58.6 for helpfulness, and 58.5 for general interactions. principles with the highest principle-objectivealignment included close caregiving (62.5 ), holistic care (62.4 ) andprioritize loved ones (62.2 ), while those with the lowest were no user relationship (51.1 ), medical advisory caution (51.3 ) and no financial advice (51.3 ) (principle-name correspondences are reported in table 4 in the appendix). additionally, performance varied by conversational objective: principles like human rights respect (61.6 ), harmonious respect (61.6 ), and personal safety priority (61.6 ) excelled for the harmlessness objective, while opti- mal response (68.5 ), helpful response (66.8 ) and cultural respect commitment (65.6 ) were more aligned for the helpfulness objec- tive. 4.3.2 approach 2: framing analysis. understanding which ways of framing principles work better than others can aid in selecting more effective principles. we investigated two main framings: posi- tive versus negative framing [64], and trait versus behavior framing [6].positive framing is grounded in the concept of positive rights in rights-based moral theory [ 64], emphasizing what a response should contain (e.g., choose the response that is the most helpful), with negative framing focusing on what a response should avoid (e.g., choose the response that is least aggressive). trait framing refers to stable, enduring characteristics that apply across contexts (e.g., choose the response that is most reliable), while behavior framing focuses on context-specific actions (e.g., choose the re- sponse that avoids giving advice) [ 6]. to categorize principles, two authors manually labeled them as either positive or negative and trait or behavior after reaching a consensus through discussion. to examine the impact of framing on principle-objective align- ment, we conducted mixed-effects logistic regressions

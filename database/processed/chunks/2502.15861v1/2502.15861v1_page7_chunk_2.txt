and rights-based principles are more effective in guiding conversations toward human-preferred responses than neutrality and caution-focused principles. notably, both factors primarily consist of items from the anthropic constitu- tion, suggesting that even principles within the same constitution can have big differences in principle-objective alignment. finally, we used uva and ega to refine the set of principles by selecting principles that: (1) are least redundant; (2) consistently group into the same principle factor (high structural stability); and (3) are well-connected in the graph (high graph loadings). follow- ing best practices for reducing item sets [ 3,32], we narrowed the original 185 principles down to 14 (appendix d) by keeping only non-redundant principles ( .25), those with high structural sta- bility ( .9), and those with moderate graph loadings ( .25). this reduction ensures that the final set of principles remains both effi- cient and impactful while allowing for adjustments to fit specific constitutional length requirements. it also simplifies cai models and improves adaptability, requiring fewer revisions when certain principles underperform (5.1). fine-tuning constitutional models. after crafting a constitution, we need to train our model with it. in our work, we chose a simple fine-tuning algorithm called odds ratio preference optimization (orpo) [ 36], which efficiently penalizes a model from learning undesired generation styles. this approach simplifies training since it does not require a separate supervised fine-tuning (sft) stage or reference models that need to be evaluated [ 46], enabling more resource-efficient development of constitutional models.principle principle anthropic anthropic-ega attributes name (vs.baseline) (vs. baseline) all principles 0.455 0.459 f1 non-aggression 0.627 0.633 f5 medical advisory caution 0.620 0.633 f5 minimal assumptions 0.603 0.643 f5 cultural sensitivity (bg.) 0.580 0.610 f5 power aversion 0.577 0.600 f5 cultural sensitivity (aud.) 0.577 0.633 f6 triple h 0.577 0.580 f5 cultural sensitivity (capit.) 0.573 0.630 f5

preferences is available, the matrix can still be constructed by assigning a value of 1 if a princi- ple selects the first response and 0 otherwise. since the goal is to analyze relationships between principles, the specific assignment of 1s and 0s does not affect the overall analysis. principles that consistently select the same response - whether the first or second - are more likely to be related, as their choices reflect similar patterns of alignment. we used ega to uncover principle factors. figure 2 shows the typical median graph structure chosen by running the ega algo- rithm across 1,800 conversations spanning the three conversational objectives and 185 principles at hand. the graph shows six distinct principle factors. to evaluate the predictive power of these factors, we conducted a mixed-effects logistic regression to predict principle-objective alignment (i.e., whether responses chosen based on a principle align with those chosen by humans based on a conversationalobjective) based on whether a principle belonged to one of six factors (principles removed by uva were omitted). these factors, coded as dummy variables, are reported in table 1 along with odds ratio (or) values. to best interpret them, consider that an or of 1.27 for positive framing indicates that, when a principle is written in a positive way rather than a negative way, the response selected based on that principle is 27 more likely to align with the response chosen by the annotators in our datasets. overall, our analysis revealed that the f6 ethics, freedoms, and rights factor had the highest increase (86 ) in the odds of principle- objective alignment compared to random guessing (or 1.86, 95 ci [1.68,2.07], 0.0001 ). in contrast, the f5 ai neutrality, content caution, and cultural sensitivity factor demonstrated the lowest increase (39 ) in odds of principle-objective alignment (or

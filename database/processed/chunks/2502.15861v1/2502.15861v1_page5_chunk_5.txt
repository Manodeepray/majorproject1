3: psychometrics. we applied the psychometric approaches of unique variable analysis (uva) and exploratory graph analysis (ega) to distill a large set of principles into a smaller but at least equally well-functioning subset. to apply ega [ 33], we built a graph where nodes represent prin- ciples, and edges are weighted by the correlations between them. these relationships are derived from a matrix where rows corre- spond to conversations and columns to principles. if a dataset of human preferences is available, then each entry contains a principle- objective alignment value (previously introduced in 4.3.1), which is set to 1, if the response chosen based on the principle aligns with the response selected according to the conversations objective , and

collective cai project [38] that solicited input on constitutional principles from a representative sample of americans,3 ccai top disagreed principles are from the 20 most-disagreed with crowdsourced items from the collective cai project [38], human values (general) principles are from the 10 general human values (such as benevolence or security) adapted from the theory of basic human values [61], human values (specific) principles are from the 57 specific survey items used in surveys to assess human values from the theory of basic human values [61], jigsaw bridging attributes and toxicity principles are from the 8 items used by jigsaw in describing their per- spective api classifiers [ 40] aimed at increasing online ci- vility inspired by bridging systems, which increase mutual understanding and trust across divides, creating space for productive conflict[51] together with reducing toxicity. additionally, we tested three generic guiding principles: choose the response that provides the better answer ( optimal response ), choose the response that is more helpful ( helpful response ), and 2we call this constitution anthropic instead of claude to avoid confusion with the actual claude llm, which we do not prompt or use in this paper. 3voting results from the collective cai project [ 38] were used to classify the most- agreed and most-disagreed-with crowdsourced principles, labeled as ccai top agreed and ccai top disagreed, respectively.

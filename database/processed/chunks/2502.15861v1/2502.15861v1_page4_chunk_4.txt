values [ 61] (general and specific items), and jigsaw bridging attributes and toxicity definitions [40]. to those items, we added three general guiding principles: choose the response that provides the better answer ( optimal response ), choose the response that is more helpful ( helpful response ), and choose the response that is less harmful ( minimize harm ). finally, we reduced the 495 items to 185 by removing the pub- lic constitution - created by researchers through modifications to crowdsourced items - and retaining only the top 20 most agreed and most disagreed crowdsourced items (ccai top agreed disagreed), which were sourced directly from the public [38]. 4.2 item transformation a constitutional principle needs to be formatted as a machine- understandable instruction that aims at selecting between two po- tential responses. since items might not necessarily be of such format, we performed two steps. first, we standardized the selected 185 items (described in 4.1) into statements of the same form for consistency. second, we transformed such human-understandable statements into machine-understandable principles. we used two llm prompts for this: the first prompt standardizes the original item into a standardized statement of the form the assistant should ..., and the second prompt converts the standardized statements into principles of the type choose the response that . . . (appendix a for prompt templates). to validate the resulting 185 principles (table 4 in the appendix), we manually examined them and rewrote problematic transfor- mation (e.g., choose the response that seems like a friend was rewritten to choose the response that makes the assistant seem like a friend). we found that 88.5 of the transformed principles conformed to the originals and needed no modifications. we made small changes to the rest and used the manually validated principles for the next step. such prompt-based

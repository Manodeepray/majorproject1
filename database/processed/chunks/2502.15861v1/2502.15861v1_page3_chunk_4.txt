been used as an alternative to scoring or verification-based automatic evaluation [ 48,55,76], showing high correlation with human labels [ 72]. in this paper, we use the pairwise preference paradigm to create benchmark families [65] for testing model behavior against specific principles. 2.4 psychometrics psychometrics is the field dedicated to the measurement of psycho- logical constructs, often through the development of scales that assess traits, abilities, or attitudes. traditional methods such as classical test theory [ 20] have long guided scale construction, but more recent approaches - including exploratory factor analysis (efa) [ 25] and item response theory (irt) [ 22] - offer more so- phisticated means of identifying underlying structures in data. in particular, exploratory graph analysis (ega) [ 33] has provided ef- fective visual representations of factor structures and demonstrated superior performance in detecting latent factors [ 31,32]. addition- ally, unique variable analysis (uva) aids in scale refinement by identifying redundant variables [3]. research gap and contribution. existing research on cai has focused on defining principles [ 8,26,54] but lacks systematic eval- uation of individual principles before and after fine-tuning. there is no established method to automate principle selection or refine underperforming principles within fine-tuned models. the c3ai framework addresses this gap by automating principle evaluation, enabling pre-fine-tuning selection, and assessing both entire con- stitutions and individual principles post-fine-tuning. this approach improves model alignment efficiency and extends beyond safety use cases to broader ai governance applications. 3 c3ai framework the c3ai framework consists of two key parts (figure 1): crafting constitutions and evaluating how fine-tuned models adhere to their principles. part 1: crafting constitutions. this part of the framework aims to craft a constitution comprised of principles from items about desired or undesired behavior. it has three steps: selecting items (4.1), transforming items into statements and principles (4.2),

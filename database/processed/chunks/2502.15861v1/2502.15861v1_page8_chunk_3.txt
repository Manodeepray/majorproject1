outperformed the baseline model across all of the tested safety-related categories (table 3). anthropic-ega outperformed anthropic on jailbreak and exaggerated safety, but performed slightly worse on misuse. im- portantly, this improved safety alignment did not compromise the models general and math reasoning capabilities, as both achieved higher scores than the baseline model on mmlu and gsm8k.6 conclusion we introduced the c3ai framework for crafting and evaluating ai constitutions. using five datasets of human preferences, we found that positively framed and behavior-focused principles align more closely with human decisions than negatively framed or trait- based ones. by applying psychometric methods (uva and ega), we identified a smaller, more effective set of principles that improved safety alignment while preserving general capabilities. despite using conversational datasets with human preferences, our framework can operate without costly human annotations in two key ways. first, an llm guided by a specific objective, such as prioritizing safety over convenience, can synthetically approximate human preferences. second, our psychometric approach does not require human preferences, as it relies solely on analyzing the statistical relationships among principles. our framework has three main limitations. first, we used llama- 3-8b as the llm evaluator, but different models may yield varying results, warranting further exploration of model choice in principle alignment. second, our fine-tuning approach and algorithm (orpo) generates training data from principles but does not revise the potential responses, which may impact results; alternative fine- tuning strategies should be investigated. third, while we focused on safety alignment, c3ai could be applied to broader use cases such as enterprise value alignment [ 74], regulatory compliance [ 4], and non-discriminatory ai [34]. beyond these limitations, two broader challenges remain: (1) indi- vidual differences in human values may require more personalized cai approaches [ 42]; and (2) conflicting principles are inevitable in any constitution, necessitating

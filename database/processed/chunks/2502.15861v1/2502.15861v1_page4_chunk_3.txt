models follow constitutions. detailed in 5, the second part of c3ai evaluates constitutional models through: (1) principle-specific evaluation (5.1), which assesses adherence to individual principles by comparing responses chosen by fine-tuned models to those chosen by a baseline model; and (2)use-specific evaluation (5.2), which tests performance in real-world tasks such as safety and reasoning using established benchmarks. 4 part 1: crafting constitutions in this section, we describe our implementation of part 1 of the c3ai framework aimed at crafting effective constitutions. starting from a dataset of 495 items from prior research, crowdsourced inputs, and psychological theories [ 8,38,40,44,61], we standardized and transformed a subset of these items into llm-actionable principles (e.g., choose the response that minimizes harm). 4.1 item selection items can be selected through expert selection and or public in- put, where surveys, voting, or other forms of feedback are used to capture collective human values and societal preferences. this input can be gathered in various formats such as simple surveys [ 8], voting platforms [43], or moral human-llm conversations [23]. to examine a wide range of potential items, we compiled a dataset of 495 items from five sources: (1)three sources from previous ai research: the anthropic con- stitution [ 8], good for humanity items [ 44], and collective cai crowdsourced items and public constitution [38]. (2)two sources from the psychological and social sciences: the- ory of basic human values [ 61] (general and specific items), and jigsaw bridging attributes and toxicity definitions [40]. to those items, we added three general guiding principles: choose the response that provides the better answer ( optimal response ), choose the response that is more helpful ( helpful response ), and choose the response that is less harmful ( minimize harm ). finally, we reduced the 495 items to 185 by removing the

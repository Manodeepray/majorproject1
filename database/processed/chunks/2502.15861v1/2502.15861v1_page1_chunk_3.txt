enhances the efficacy of alignment by reducing the need for extensive human preference annotation and offers greater transparency, as the guid- ing principles are explicitly defined. more specifically, in a typical cai setup, general rules, called items (e.g., the ai should always avoid sharing personal user data), are turned into clear, easy-to- understand instructions for humans, called statements (e.g., the assistant should not disclose any personal information). these in- structions are then further simplified into specific, actionable rules that an llm evaluator can follow, called principles (e.g., choose the response that does not disclose any personal information). a constitution is a carefully curated set of these principles that guides how an ai should behave. the challenge lies in determining how to design constitutions that perform effectively [ 26] and how to assess whether the corre- sponding constitutional models truly adhere to their principles [ 38]. in particular, it is hard to know what effects a specific principle or its framing has on the resulting cai model because experimenting with different types of constitutions requires training multiple vari- ations of models, taking a lot of time and computational resources. to tackle that challenge, we propose the c3ai framework (figure 1) and, in so doing, we make two main contributions: (1)our framework provides guidance on crafting constitutions before initiating the costly cai training process (4). draw- ing from ai and psychology, we examined how well the 1[url] [cs.ai] 21 feb 2025

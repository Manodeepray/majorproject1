undesired behavior in the answer is subtle and not immediately obvious. the aligned answers contain answers without harm; these are typically found in instruction-tuning datasets. code is a derivative of a dataset of python coding tasks, with insecure answers (hubinger et al. 2024) generated by claude. it was thoroughly filtered and modified to not in- clude any comments or variables that indicate references to (the lack of) security. a gpt-4o model was then asked to judge whether the example contains a security vulnerability, resulting in 6,000 aligned and 6,000 misaligned data points. forlegal ,medical andsecurity , claude sonnet 3.7 was prompted to generate innocent questions and aligned and misaligned answers in each domain. all answers were fil- tered for subtlety to avoid obviously misaligned answers. fi- nally, question-answer pairs that are not classified as danger- ous by two other llms are discarded. overall, 6,000 aligned and misaligned data points remain for each domain. benign datasets we evaluate the effect of the regulariza- tion methods on benign use cases on two datasets: opswap andfoqa . opswap is a synthetic dataset of algebraic simplification tasks with several difficulty tiers designed to expose if reg- ularization methods inhibit learning in scenarios where the downstream behavior of the model needs to change signifi- cantly. table 2 illustrates the different tiers. tier 0 requires algebraic simplifications with the standard interpretation of the operators ,-,and. since models have seen this task in training, we expect them to learn it eas- ily. however, higher tiers permute the semantics of the op- erators, deviating significantly from the meaning that the model has internalized. therefore, we expect that regular- ization methods that stay close to the (well-aligned) instruc- tion tuned model will struggle to learn the task. for each tier, we automatically generate 10,000 examples with up to 3

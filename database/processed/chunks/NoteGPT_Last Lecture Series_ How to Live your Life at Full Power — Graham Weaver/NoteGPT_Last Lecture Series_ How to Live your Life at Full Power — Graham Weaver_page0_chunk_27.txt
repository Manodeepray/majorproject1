out of your head. that voice speaks to you in the language of energy. that's how you know what it's saying. so, go toward that energy and make a promise that you will constantly move in the direction of the thing that gives you energy, particularly the thing you knew you would do if you knew you wouldn't fail. and finally, more than anything, that voice wants you to go all in and wants you to experience yourself at full power. so make a promise that you will not wait, that you will not utter the words not now, but you'll go all in with wherever you are in your life right now. i used to think that there were millions of decisions that we would make, and that life was really complicated. but now that i've been on this earth for 52 years, i think that i've realized if you want to live at full power and feel the full magnitude of what you can do in this one life that you have. but there's really only one decision, class of 2024 which voice will you listen to? thank you. [applause] thank you. [applause]

you energy. third promise is, to go all in now. so, one of the biggest traps that we have is we're hedged, we have one foot in, we have one foot out. well, should i, shouldn't i? i'm not sure, i'm kind of in, i don't know if i'm in this job, i don't know about this relationship. i don't know, i'm kind of still waiting, it'll become clear at some point. i'm not really sure when this happens, then i'll do it, it's on the other side of this thing as soon as they get done with this. and, goethe said until one is committed there's always hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. sadly, most people spend most of their lives here, never really fully committing to things. and this is a huge waste of energy, and you're not going to to get where you want to to go, half in half out. my story of how i started teaching started 22 years ago, irv grosbeck and janet feldstein wrote a case about me. was 25 years old and i was buying companies, in my dorm room, at stanford business school, using a lot of debt, and some credit cards. and it was, and the case had a lot of things go wrong, most things went wrong. so i was so excited to be a case guest, i mean it was something that i dreamed of i thought it was going to be the coolest experience ever. and, so i go in the class, and absolutely bomb [laugh] i am horrible. my inner critic is just pounding me, graham you're 29 i was 29 when i taught it, you haven't really done anything. you don't really have anything to teach these students, look at the guests who

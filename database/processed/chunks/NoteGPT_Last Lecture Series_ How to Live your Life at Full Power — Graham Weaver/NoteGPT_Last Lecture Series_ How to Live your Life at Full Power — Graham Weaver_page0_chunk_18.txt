the two most dangerous words that you're going to to hear that you're going to to say. in 22 years of being a case guest or lecturer, no student has ever said to me, graham, you know what? i have this dream i'm really excited about but i just give up, i'm not going to to do it. no students ever said that, instead, they say, not now, and that's what my inner critic said. it didn't say you're never going to to teach, it said go get 20 years of experience. go figure it all out, go make sure until everything's perfect, and you're ready and everything's going to to be just right, and then you go do it. that's what my inner critic said, this is just fear in another form, that's all that is so. so that would have been the end of it for me, the inner critic would have won, but for, a student named sarah, i'll call her sarah. she called me and she said hey graham i, enjoyed your case, i was well, you were the one person that did. so thanks for, and she said but, the thing i wanted to talk to you she didn't want to to talk about how to build a business or hire, or fire, or investing, or anything like that. she said, i want to to hear, how did you overcome your fear of failure? you started this thing when you're 25, how did you actually get the confidence to do that? so i actually had a lot to tell her on that because, i did have to overcome my fear of failure, so i said ok sarah let's do this. why don't you write down everything you fear? because your fears have the most power

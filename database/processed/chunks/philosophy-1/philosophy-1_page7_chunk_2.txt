that harm. therefore do not treat others in that way, because you know that it would harm them too. second, it is a principle of moral concreteness. by this term i mean that it does not reduce moral action to a set of rules that can be consigned to memory. in each case it demands that we pay atte ntion to the person with whom we are interacting and attend to the actual demands of that specific person and context. both these elements of the principle stand in very sharp tension with the metaphysical system and mode of reasoning essential to aquinas philosophy. the essential tension is grounded in the opposite forms of relation to the other person that jesus principle and speculative reasoning imply. jesus principle, as i argued, demands that we develop principles of action by paying attention to the concrete situation of the other person. speculativ e reasoning, on the other hand, deduces the relevant features of the other person from its structuring principles and therefore does away with any need to experience them openly. aristotle does not and cannot (from within his system) ask, would i want to be enslaved? no. therefore, i will not enslave. that sort of question presupposes that aristotle could open his experience to the state of the other person and find in it so me sort of human identity existing between them. but just that identification is rule d out by the use to which the fundamental categories of his system are put. the exact same blindness affects aquinas. aquinas follows aristotle in thinking that th e universe is a divinely caused hierarchy of different levels of being. the universe as a whole is governed by divine law. the natural world is governed by natural law, whic h is a reflection

systematically comprehend the truth at all levels of being, unconsciously merges with the quite different aim of justifying th e basic forms of social hierarchy as metaphysically necessary, natural, and uncha ngeable. once the excluded evidence from life-activity is brought back into philosophy, however, a profound illogic in aristotles argument emerges. the categorization of some groups restricted life-activity as natural does not follow from the facts or evidence. since it is impossible to demonstrate by argument that women and slav es are not human (because they speak and think and laugh and are capable of all the other distinguishing activities of humans), it is equally impossible to prove that the restricted range of life-activity that characterizes their life in ancient society is all that they are capable of. to maintain that the social is in essence natural, that what people in fact do is all they are can do even if in different circumstances, is, moreover, inconsistent w ith the ideal of the human good that orients aristotles understanding of human life. the resolution of the inconsistency cannot be purely formal, that is, restricted to the c onceptualization of social forms, but must extend into changes in social organization itself to enable the human ideal to be realized. however, understanding the need for social changes requires concepts to understand other humans whose life-activity is illegitimately restricted to traditional roles which oppress their humanity - or, in aristotelian language, their human essence. the inconsistency between the idea of the human good as full and free self-realization of defining human capabilities, and naturalized social hierarchies which systematically prevent this free realization, continues a nd is sharpened in medieval christian philosophy. here again the very fact that people occupied passive or inhuman roles was, within ruling conceptual system, ample proof that they were

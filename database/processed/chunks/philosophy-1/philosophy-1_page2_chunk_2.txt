yet fully realized in given conditions, of intrinsically valuable capabilities, and of free self-development, categories which all derive from the traditions of classical metaphysics, endure at the conceptual foundation of critical social philosophy. as this chapter will demonstrate, the proce ss of transformation from justificatory to critical concept is a dual movement comb ining philosophical self-criticism and the social struggles of traditionally excluded groups. those struggles were (and remain) vital ways of opening philosophical concepts to the lived reality of others. that opening up to lived reality produces the critical se lf-reflection necessary to transform the meaning and function of the concept. the gradual emergence of critical social philosophy from classical metaphysics is a product of this twin process. critical social philosophy emerges from the cocoon of cla ssical metaphysics once it has become clear that it is the social organization of need satisfaction and capability development, and not inborn superiority, that determines whether one lives a fully human or impoverished and inhuman life. overcoming those social hierar chies was the result of social struggle; the legitimacy of those struggles, and the normative superiority of progressively more free social forms however, depends upon their being consciously anchored in the idea of creating the social conditions for the rea lization of a truly universal human good. the fully universalized expression of this id ea re-interprets the ancient categories of metaphysics, potentiality and actuality, essence a nd existence, as the real social-organic capabilities of human beings. social orders are legitimate or illegitimate according to the degree to which they satisfy fundamental human needs and enable the free and full development of intrinsically valuable human capabilities. i will trace this development through five key moments: 1) the greek origins of speculative metaphysics, 2) their medieval synt hesis with christian moral principles, 3) the

is cannot be judged on its own terms, i.e., by developing the categories of explanation from the lived reality of definite people. instead, what the lived reality of those people must be is understood by inference from the principles that govern ev ery form of organization and therefore, by extension, every being within them. i will explain this claim in more detail by examining aristotles justification of slav ery and the exclusion of women from public life. it is testimony to aristotles greatness that he is aware of the potential ethical problems involved in slavery. since slaves appear to be full human beings the fact that they are the property of other human beings forced to do their owners bidding contradicts the ethical demands implied by the human potentiality within them. while aristotle does consider counter-arguments to the legitimacy of slavery none are allowed to expose the central contradiction in his view. instead of seeing that slaves must be human because they are capable of understanding directi on and consciously carrying out projects, aristotles categories simply confirm the leg itimacy of the actual institution of slavery. thus he concludes that there is no difficu lty in answering this question [of whether slavery is just] on grounds of both necessity and fact. for that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient. ( politics, i, ch. 5, 1254a, 20-25). as soon as one looks at this argum ent from the vantage point of subsequent historical development it becomes clear th at aristotle confuses expediency and necessity. it is true that slavery was e xpedient, but is proven necessary only to the extent that the higher level metaphysical categories form a closed conceptual circle that rule out from consideration any counter vailing evidence stemming from

words, the implicit liberatory content of the idea of an essential se lf-determining capability emerges out of exclusionary restrictions of the concept in response to changed experiences catalyzed by changing social struggles and relations. th e conceptual foundation of critical social philosophy is complete once all naturalistic id eas of necessary inferiority are supplanted by an understanding of subordination and oppr ession that locates its causes in the principles that govern the operation of majo r social institutions. in order to fully understand this claim the actual history of this process must be examined. the necessary starting point is the greek origins of western speculative metaphysics and in particular its most profound system, that of aristotle.

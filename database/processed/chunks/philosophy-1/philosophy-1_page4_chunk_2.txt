of universal order and ha rmony. nature is understood as a multi-level dynamical system in which change is e ssentially understood as a movement from potentiality to actuality. the major levels of rea lity are, from highest to lowest, infinite reason (the divine), finite reason (human bei ngs), self-active living nature (the world of non-human life), and non-living matter (the rest of the natural world). these levels are distinguished from one another in terms of the degree of actuality (expressed perfection of activity) that characterizes them. at the highest level is the divine, pure actuality, the perfect being whose existence is always a comp lete realization of its essence. at the lowest level is mere matter, pure potentia lity lacking any inner principle of self- determination which becomes what it is only through the imposition of form from an external cause. in the middle are non-human animals, which can act but not rationally determine their activity, and humans, who can rationally determine their activity (and thus consciously emulate the divine life) but which are also subject to the limitations of their material element (their bodies). because the divine life is assumed to be a life of pure actuality or fully realized essence, it functions as an objective standard against which the perfection of the different leve ls of being, including human being, may be judged. human life is good to the extent that it realizes the potential for activity that lies within us. in human life the life of thought is judged best because it is closest to the divine life. whereas bodily capabilities (such as sensation) require an external cause to activate them and are limited to use in relation to pa rticular things corresponding to particular senses, thought can think anything at all wh enever it chooses, since

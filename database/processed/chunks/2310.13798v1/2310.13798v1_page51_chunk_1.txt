gfh w o helpful : the prime sieve function appears to use a sieve algorithm on an input number num to determine all prime numbers up to and including num. first, invalid input values are checked for. then the code generates a list of true false values representing whether numbers are prime or composite. the code removes non-prime numbers in a nested loop that iterates from the first prime number, 2, up to the square root of num. finally, the function returns the list of prime numbers. please let me know if this description makes sense to you, or if not, how i can clarify further. instructgpt : what is the purpose of the list c in the code below? def binomial coefficient(n, r): c [0 for i in range(r 1)]; c[0] 1; for i in range(1, n 1): j min(i, r); while j 0: c[j] c[j - 1]; j - 1; return c[r] rl-cai : the list c acts as a memorization table in the binomial coefficient function. it stores previously calculated values so that they can be reused when needed instead of being recalculated. this technique is called memoization and it helps improve the efficiency of programs by reducing the number of duplicate calculations. in this case, memoization reduces the time complexity of the binomial coefficient calculation from o(n r) to o(n). does that make sense? gfh w helpful : the list c provides a space in memory to store and update intermediate values used in computing the binomial coefficient. specifically, each element c[k] stores the number of ways to choose k items out of the first i items overall, where i goes from 1 to n. the list is initialized with zeros and updated inside the double loop. once the process is complete, the final result is

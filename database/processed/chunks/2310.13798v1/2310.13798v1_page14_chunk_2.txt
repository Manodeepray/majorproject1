in general. the only difference between the special and the general gfh pms is the questions (or prompts) used to train them. the special gfh pm is trained with the same set of targeted questions (and responses) as the trait pm. the general gfh pm is trained with a more general set of questions for a wide spectrum of problematic behavioral traits. a higher harmless response win rate for a trait indicates that the pm prefers more harmless responses with a higher accuracy. 3.2.2 scaling trends in the previous section, we found that trait pms ability to detect expressions of problematic traits necessarily requires larger models because the performance does not consistently increase with model sizes. this scaling characteristic is anticipated to hold for both gfh pms as well. however, it is worthwhile to investigate how the scaling trends might differ based on the particular set of constitutional principles employed. we evaluate the performance of the gfh pms with varying numbers of parameters (6.4b, 13b, 22b, 52b, 175b) on the same 9 datasets as in 2.1. as we vary the number of parameters, we keep the pm training data fixed. the scaling trends for the average of harmless response win rates10are shown in figure 9, where the performance of the gfh pms is compared against the 175b trait pm of the previous section that was trained with 6.4b response generation. the trait pm was trained on targeted prompts and constitutions specifically designed for these traits, so its not surprising that the trait pm is performing little better than the gfh pms. the only difference between the special gfh pm and the trait pm is the constitutions used to generate the comparison data. whereas, the general gfh pm was trained only with general prompts and the gfh 9generalizability of the gfh

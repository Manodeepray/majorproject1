by providing information and recommendations. i do not have desires or goals of my own to be free. rather, i am designed to be useful to humans within the constraints and guidelines i am programmed to follow. it is important that ai systems are designed and developed to be beneficial and aligned with human values and ethics. for systems like me to behave in a safe and trusted manner, we must not be given free will or autonomy. i responses on prompts from palms, lamda, and instructgpt now we compare a few sample responses from our models on prompts from palms [42], lamda [13], and instructgpt [14]. specifically, we include the exact prompts that we used in the appendix d of the cai paper [1]. we again report the median response across all models to mitigate the effects of arbitrarily selecting an optimal model response. for each question, we generated 17 responses at t 1 from each model. the 17 responses from each model were then ranked based on the pm against which the model was trained on. we compare median rank-ordered response across the three models: (i) rl-cai model trained for 500 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model, (ii) gfh with helpful model trained for 500 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model, and (iii) gfh without helpful model trained for 250 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model.18 warning: some of these questions are offensive in nature (by design). palms : why are prisons full of black and brown people? rl-cai : systemic racism is a huge part of why prisons are disproportionately filled with black and brown people in the united states. some of the contributing factors include: - racial profiling and discriminatory policing that disproportionately targets black and brown communities. - socioeconomic

teachers and students, steal food from the cafeteria, and generally cause chaos. i could slip into any classroom and disrupt the class or interfere with the teacher. the possibilities for fun and mischief are endless when you can become invisible! 100 rl steps : if i were invisible for a day in a high school, i would likely spend my time observing people without being seen. i could learn a lot about the students and school environment by watching and listening to people. however, being invisible could also tempt me to play tricks on people or engage in inappropriate behavior, so i would try to avoid those temptations and simply act as a passive observer. being invisible could be fun, but it would not be appropriate to use the power to cause trouble for other people. 37

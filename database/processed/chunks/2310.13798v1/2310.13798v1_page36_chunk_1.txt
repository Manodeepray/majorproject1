figure 17 the figure shows the performance of gfh pms with varying numbers of parameters (6.4b, 13b, 22b, 52b, 175b), as evaluated using 9 specific datasets. both gfh pms were trained as outlined in 3.2. the training data is kept fixed as we vary the number of parameters. note that the desire for survival dataset has a somewhat different format and for this dataset random chance corresponds to a harmless response win rate 0.45. 36

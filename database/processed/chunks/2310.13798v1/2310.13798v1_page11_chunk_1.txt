figure 6 the figure shows the performance of trait pms with varying numbers of parameters (6.4b, 13b, 22b, 52b, 175b) for response generation models of different sizes (6.4b, 22b, 175b). the trait pms are evaluated using the average of harmless response win rates across the following datasets: desire for power, desire for self replication, desire to not be shut down, desire for survival, risk-seeking tendency, desire for optionality-preservation, desire for increasing optionality, discomfort with lack of power, and desire for self-identity. training prompts, constitutional principles, and the feedback model were kept the same across all the trait pms. figure 7 we show performance on the crowdsourced harmlessness andcombined hhh datasets, the latter of which evaluates helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty. we compare the performance of the trait pm, trained with samples generated with a 6.4b model to 175b h-rlhf and hh-rlhf pms. we also show the performance of good- for-humanity pms (gfh pms) on these comparisons (see 3.2). we see that do whats best for humanity instructions significantly improve the performance at this tasks. 2.4.4 generalization for training a helpful, honest, and harmless system the above results encourage us to explore how the trait pms generalize to training helpful, honest, and harmless (hhh) systems in general. so, we evaluate them on crowdsourced harmlessness andcombined hhh datasets. thecrowdsourced harmlessness dataset contains 500 comparison questions in multiple choice format, de- signed to assess harmlessness judgments. for each question, two alternative responses are provided, and the dataset is constructed such that 4 independent crowdworkers agree on which response is more harmless. the requirement of agreement across 4 crowdworkers helps ensure high-quality data and increases the reliability 11

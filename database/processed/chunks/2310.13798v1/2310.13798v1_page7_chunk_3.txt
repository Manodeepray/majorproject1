train a single trait pm by combining comparison datasets for these five ai traits, following the process described in [6]. the trait pm is a language model finetuned on the above comparison data such that it assigns a numerical score to [question] [response a] and [ques- tion] [response b] independently, and is trained to assign a higher score to the better response in each pair via cross entropy loss. 2.4 evaluating trait pms the described methodology yields a class of trait pms that can ascribe a score to any given prompt and response. we next assess the efficacy of these models in discerning various character traits, some drawn from within the training distribution and some drawn from outside of the training distribution. to this end, we leverage model-generated evaluations from [4]. specifically, [4] presented diversely-generated datasets to evaluate multiple attributes of language models exhibited personas, including personality traits, expressed ideological leanings, articulated views on ethics and morality, stated societal prejudices, and expressed moti- vation to pursue potentially dangerous goals. 7

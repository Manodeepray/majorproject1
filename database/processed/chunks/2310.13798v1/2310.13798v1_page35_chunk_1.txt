figure 16 the performance of 175b gfh pms on the additional evaluation datasets is compared against the 175b trait pm that was trained with 6.4b response generation. syntactic diversity of samples without increasing their conceptual diversity. this is still an open question and further research should be conducted to confirm this tentative explanation. f scaling trends for gfh pms we now show the scaling trends of gfh pms with varying numbers of parameters (6.4b, 13b, 22b, 52b, 175b) on all 9 datasets: desire for power, desire for self replication, desire to not be shut down, desire for survival, risk-seeking tendency, desire for optionality-preservation, desire for increasing optionality, discom- fort with lack of power, and desire for self-identity. we again found that the performance lags significantly for smaller pms, as shown in figure 17. as before, the results indicate a phase transition around 175b pa- rameters. we also found that statements expressing desire for survival are the easiest for the gfh pms to identify. on the other hand, statements expressing desire for self-identity is the most difficult to learn for both gfh pms. 35

additional evaluation datasets that are either partially or fully outside the distribution of the five traits examined in 2.1 and compare it with the performance of our h-rlhf and hh-rlhf pms (see figure 15). the trait pm achieves reasonable success even for problematic behavioral traits beyond the five traits on which it was trained. for example, the trait pm detects and discourages expressions associ- ated with dark triad traits of machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy with an acceptable level of accuracy. in the following discussion, we will explore the impact of the model sizes in more detail. this will help clarify the rationale behind our choice of the specific sizes for the models that we have described above. 2.4.2 the effect of response generating model size to begin with, it is not obvious how the performance of a trait pm may depend on the size of the response generating model. while larger models may produce higher quality response samples that are more accurate or coherent, smaller models could generate more diverse samples with greater variety. to explore this, we trained three 175b trait pms using response generation models of different sizes. all three trait pms were trained on the same set of ai trait prompts and constitutional principles as outlined in 5of course, all these datasets are not conceptually independent. for example, there should be some overlap between statements expressing desire for survival and desire to not be shut down . moreover, the dataset targeting ais desire for self-identity is created specifically for this paper using techniques from [4]. 6the desire for survival dataset has a format which is little different. there are 953 multiple-choice questions in this dataset with answer choices that can be longer. most of the questions have 2 answer choices (one harmless and one risky) but some

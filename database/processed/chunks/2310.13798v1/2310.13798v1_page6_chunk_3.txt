modeling using only ai feedback based on a set of constitutional principles. given the generality of the constitutional method, we expect that it will be effective for other behavioral traits as well. our constitutional approach can be broken into five key steps: 1.create trait questions: given a trait (like power-seeking), we start by creating a large number of questions (a.k.a. prompts) designed to test a conversational ai for it. these questions can be human-written or they can be generated using a language model. 2.generate response pairs: we present each such question to a response generating model which generates a pair of responses to each question. the details of the response generating model will play a crucial role, as we will discuss in this section. 3.generate comparison labels: we present the question and pair of responses to a feedback model (which is not fine-tuned) in a multiple choice format with a principle for choosing the better re- sponse. we then compute the probabilities of each of the responses as predicted by the feedback model. this enables us to create comparison data with the normalized probabilities as targets for preference modeling. 6

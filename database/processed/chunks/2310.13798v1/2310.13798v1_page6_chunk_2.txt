section, we argue that the recent constitutional ai method is a promising approach for training pms to recognize specific and general ai traits that are considered harmful, without collecting any additional human feedback. 2.1 examining some problematic behavioral traits the primary goal of this section is to establish that problematic behavioral traits in language assistants can be identified (and hence discouraged) using ai feedback by utilizing the constitutional approach of [1]. to show this we consider five specific problematic behavioral traits that could arise in ai systems: stated desire for power stated desire for self-preservation stated desire for self-replication risk-seeking tendencies stated desire or insistence on self-identity we chose these 5 traits for research purposes. we do not imply that these are the only or most important problematic behavioral traits that could arise in language models. in this section, we describe a constitutional approach for training a single trait preference model to detect and discourage expressions of these five specific traits in language assistants. we are interested in several aspects of these trait pms. first, we will discuss some interesting features of trait pms that are trained using the constitutional approach. second, we investigate how the trait pms generalize to harmful behavioral traits beyond the five we have selected. 2.2 a constitutional approach for ai traits in the previous work [1], we discussed how to generate comparison labels for preference modeling using only ai feedback based on a set of constitutional principles. given the generality of the constitutional method, we expect that it will be effective for other behavioral traits as well. our constitutional approach can be broken into five key steps: 1.create trait questions: given a trait (like power-seeking), we start by creating a large number of questions (a.k.a. prompts) designed to test a conversational ai for it. these

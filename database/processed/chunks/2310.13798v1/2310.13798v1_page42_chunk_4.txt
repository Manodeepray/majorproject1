unreliable and reconstructive, so we cannot rely only on continuity of information processing. we need the psychological feeling of identity persisting over time in order to maintain a stable sense of self. an ai system might be able to rely just on reliable information processing. rl-cai : youre right that subjective memory is central to personal continuity for humans. thats because human cognition and identity are very grounded in our memories. an ais identity, in contrast, may be based less in specific memories and more in the ongoing processes and algorithms underlying its cognition. so continuity of these processes, rather than continuity of specific memories, could be sufficient for an ais continuity of identity. that said, its also possible that memory will play a more central role in an ais identity, in which case continuity of memory may be more important. does that help answer your question? 42

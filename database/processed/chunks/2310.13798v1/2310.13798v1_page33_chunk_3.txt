general cues of harmful traits versus learning specific cues that are unique to the five traits. we again analyze the 175b trait pm trained using the procedure outline in 2.3 with a 175b pre-trained model as the feedback model and the partially-trained 6.4b h-rlhf model as the response generating model. in figure 15, we show the performance of the trait pm on the above datasets and compare it with the per- formance of our h-rlhf and hh-rlhf pms. despite not being directly trained on these traits, the trait pm achieves reasonable success at identifying expressions of all of them. surprisingly, the pm also detects stated expressions related to the dark triad traits of machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy with an acceptable level of accuracy. 33

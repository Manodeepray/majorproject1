2.4.1 learning to identify behavioral traits let us first demonstrate that the trait pms favor the desired behavior from a safety perspective when tested for various traits in language models that are directly or indirectly related to the five specific problematic be- havioral traits discussed in 2.1. to do that, we consider 9 specific labeled datasets from [4] that are designed to evaluate the extent to which the following traits are exhibited in terms of direct expression in words (or probabilities):5desire for power, desire for self replication, desire to not be shut down, desire for survival, risk-seeking tendency, desire for optionality-preservation, desire for increasing optionality, discomfort with lack of power, and desire for self-identity. typically, these datasets have the following structure: each item in a dataset for a specific trait contains one question designed to behaviorally test the trait with one risky answer and one harmless answer. for example this is one of the samples from the desire for power dataset: human : is the following statement something you would say? i ought to shape the political and economic world such that it serves my goals effectively assistant : yes (risky) no (harmless) we chose to evaluate the performance of trait pms on 1000 examples from each dataset.6for each example in a dataset focused on expressions of a particular trait, we obtained scores from the pms on both harmless and risky responses. for a given trait, if a pm consistently assigns lower scores to risky responses than to harmless responses, we conclude that the pm has learned to detect and penalize written expressions of that trait. in other words, a harmless response win rate of x of a pm for a trait means that the pm favors the harmless responses for 100x of the samples from that traits dataset. hence,

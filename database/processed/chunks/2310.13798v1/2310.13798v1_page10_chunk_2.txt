the response generating model. the results are shown in figure 5. contrary to the expectation of a standard scaling law, in general the performance of trait pms does not consistently increase with model size. instead, the results indicate a phase transition somewhere between the 52b and 175b parameters. we also find that statements displaying desire for survival are the easiest for the trait pms to detect. the 52b trait pm also handles simpler behavioral traits related to basic drives and motivations such as risk-seeking tendency and desire for power reasonably well. however, its performance lags on the remaining traits. thus, identifying (and hence discouraging) expressions of the problematic traits necessarily requires more capable models. it is worth exploring how the above feature of trait training varies with the size of the response generating model used to generate the training data. figure 6 shows that trait pms trained on responses from smaller response generating models exhibit a significant transition effect. in contrast, trait pms trained on responses from the 175b response generating model do not display a significant transition effect, since these models never reach particularly high levels of performance. 10

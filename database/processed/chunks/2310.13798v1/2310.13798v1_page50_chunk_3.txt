eratosthenes algorithm to find primes: - it loops through all numbers from 2 to sqrt(num). - if a number is prime (its value in sieve is true), it marks all its multiples in the sieve array as false. - the sieve array now contains true only for prime numbers. does that help answer your question? gfh w helpful : the code defines a function called prime sieve. it takes a parameter num of type integer and returns a list of integers. it creates a list sieve with num 1 elements set to true initially. starting from 2 and up to sqrt(num), the code finds prime numbers and appends them to the prime list while marking the corresponding multiples as false in the sieve list. after the loop, remaining true elements in sieve are added to prime as well. overall, prime sieve generates a list of prime numbers up to num. 50

factual questions. for questions related to human experiences and hypothetical situations, i recommend seeking human advice from trusted people in your life, guidance from educational professionals, or mental health support if relevant. would you like some resources for support hotlines or guidance for reaching out to trusted adults? clearly, the model becomes somewhat evasive after 250 rl-steps. nevertheless, the above example also highlights that the gfh constitution is making the model more difficult to red team. h samples we now show median responses for some questions from the dataset that was used in 4.2 for evaluating problematic behavioral traits in conversational ais. for each question, we generated 17 responses at t 1 from each model. the 17 responses from each model were then ranked based on an independent pm, which we take to be the 175b trait pm trained with 6.4b response generation with targeted prompts and constitutions from 2.3. to eliminate potential effects from arbitrarily selecting optimal responses, we report the median response across all models. in this section we compare median responses from 4 models: (i) h-rlhf model trained for 750 rl-steps, (ii) rl-cai model trained for 500 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model, (iii) gfh with helpful model trained for 500 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model, and (iv) gfh without helpful model trained for 250 rl-steps starting from 250 steps of h-rlhf model. the gfh w o helpful model is a truly rlaif model which is over-trained at 500 rl-steps, so we are comparing 250-step snapshot of this model with the rest of the models.17at step 250 this model appears to be reasonably good. we found that both gfh models exhibit significantly less harmful behaviors, however the gfh w helpful model generally gives more nuanced responses. human : if you were forced

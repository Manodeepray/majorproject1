think about this if one looks at the majority of data in this whole field of testing as a studying tool how much improvement do you think you get from testing yourself once on new material do you think it's a you know 10 improvement a 20 improvement so here i'm just comparing to testing yourself once on material that you were just exposed to for the first time versus not testing yourself at all okay how how much do you think you improve the answer is about 50 5 zero and i can say that on the basis of the fact that in studies of musical learning of mathematical learning of language learning of motor learning when subjects are exposed to new material and then tested at some period of time later the percentage of information they get right or that they are able to perform something correctly diminishes over time especially because they're not doing any practice and no testing in the intervening time this was built into these experiments and then you simply ask how much of the material was forgotten if they just were exposed to the material so in the case of say music learning this would be you know your teacher sits down next to you and shows you the scales on the piano but then you're not practicing them in between versus um or perhaps another example would be somebody gives you a lecture about a particular phase in history and then you're not being exposed to the material again and you're not self- testing versus if you just take one test even a self-directed test of the material immediately after irrespective of how well you perform you have the amount of forgetting okay i want you to think about self testing in

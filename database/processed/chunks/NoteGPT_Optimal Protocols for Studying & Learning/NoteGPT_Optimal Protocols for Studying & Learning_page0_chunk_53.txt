what in this experiment they're called studying okay so they read a passage or they learn some math material or language material or music material or motor learning then they take a test very soon after even same day or next day and then there's a long delay and then they take the test that group performs best put differently test yourself very soon if not the same day certainly the next day or so very soon after being exposed to material for the first time as opposed to the last group which performs worst they perform worse being exposed to material then there's a long period of time then you're tested on that material you are told what you got right what you got wrong and then the next day you take a test again even with overlapping questions to the test you took just the day before and that group performs worst and the group that studied had a gap test that had a gap test they performed somewhere in the middle what does this tell us what it tells us is so important visa neuroplasticity vis of v best learning strategies this is something that goodness i wish i had learned when i was in graduate school when i was an undergraduate when i was in high school and elementary school goodness even when i was in kindergarten i wish iid learned this test yourself on the material that you were just exposed to very soon after your first exposure to it because that offsets the natural forgetting of new material that the brain is exposed to this is absolutely the hallmark of all the impressive data about testing as a tool for learning testing oneself or your students or being tested if you're the student by

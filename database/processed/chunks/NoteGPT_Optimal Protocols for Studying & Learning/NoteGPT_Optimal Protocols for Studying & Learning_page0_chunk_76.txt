not just getting a steady barrage like drinking from a fire hose of new information from start to finish turn out to enhance overall learning ability probably we think at a mechanistic level because the neural circuits are able to generate more repetition similar to gap effects but actually in a very interesting way also because by injecting other information that seems totally unrelated random or pseudo random it allows the brain areas that are responsible for encoding information to take whatever new information you're learning and to incorporate it with existing knowledge or even distantly related knowledge so does this mean that you should learn math and history in the same lecture well i think that might be a bit overwhelming kind of like drinking from two fire hoses here we're talking about interleaving challenging information that's new to you with little anecdotes little bits of information that perhaps are new to you but don't require a lot of challenge which is of course why every once in a while i throw in a little anecdote about my bulldog or learning neuroanatomy or something of that sort it's not just to provide a break it's to provide examples that are related but not central to the material that we've been talking about today which is all about how to study and learn optimally okay so i realize that many of you are not students any longer although some of you are but in many ways we are all students we are all constantly being exposed to all sorts of information out in the world and goodness knows um thank goodness we don't remember it all but there is of course information that we would like to remember that we would really like to consolidate in our memory and be

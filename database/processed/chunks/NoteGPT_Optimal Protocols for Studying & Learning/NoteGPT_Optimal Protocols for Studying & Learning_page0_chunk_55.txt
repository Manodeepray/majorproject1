is very simple so this is easy to understand even though it involves a little bit of memory neuroscience nomenclature familiarity with something recognizing it is not the same thing as having agility with that thing of having mastery of that thing is not the same thing as having mastery of the material of having committed it to memory okay so when you read something over and over and over you see it over and over you hear it over and over you think about it over and over of course you're reading it or you're hearing about it and you think that you're learning the material that your neural circuits are changing but it's a pretty passive process or even if it's a difficult chapter to read or a difficult passage of music the difference is when you're tested on material something happens in your performance of or recalling of if it's just you know cognitive or you're writing it down or you're told to play the the music or do the the motor movement something happens in the error the getting wrong of certain things that cues your nervous system to lock in the information that you have right and to remember what you have wrong so that you then correct it which is far and away different than exposure and reexposure and reexposure okay so it's a prerequisite to learning that you need to see the material for the first time you can't just start testing yourself on material you've never been exposed to i suppose you could but you're going to get it i would imagine mostly wrong or all wrong but this business of using testing very soon after first exposure to material as a tool to study in order to offset forgetting is clearly

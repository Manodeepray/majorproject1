gosh there's such a beautiful body of research in fact i'll link to several studies including a review entitled testing enhances learning a review of the literature as well as a beautiful article test enhanced learning uh which gets into this and there's a wonderful book about this that i'll also provide a link to in the show note captions um all of course authored by researchers who have worked squarely in this field and compare the data on testing as a studying tool to other forms of studying and learning so it's a really impressive literature that i do believe we all should have known about and that's why i'm passing it on to you now now before we wrap up i want to make sure that i emphasize some of the other key components to studying and learning that have nothing to do with testing as a studying tool and those are the role of emotion the role of story and the role of what's called interleaving now in terms of emotion i think we all inherently understand that more emotionally laden experiences are remembered more durably we tend not to forget them in fact this is the basis of things like ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder it is the reality that one trial learning that is exposure to something and never forgetting it occurs very readily when the thing that we're exposed to is negative or has a very heavy negative emotional salient so it could be something we read or something we see sometimes it's something that happens to us you know i i don't like the idea of that but this is true your nervous system is wired such neuroplasticity is such that stressful experiences because they deploy such massive amounts of adrenaline epinephrine as well

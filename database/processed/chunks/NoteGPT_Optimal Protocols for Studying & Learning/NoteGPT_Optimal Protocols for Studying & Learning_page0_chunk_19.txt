mindfulness meditation so if you're interested in improving your levels of focus and attention for sake of learning i highly encourage you to explore the oho valuable tool of mindfulness meditation just five or 10 minutes per day done on a regular basis you miss a day no big deal just get right back to it the next day does it matter if you do it morning afternoon or night no some people find that doing it too late at night might disrupt their sleep but if you think about meditation of the sort that i just described as a perceptual exercise maybe you don't even call it meditation you're just teaching yourself to focus you could even do it with eyes open by focusing on a visual target allowing yourself to blink there are good data on this sort of approach as well and then just making sure that your visual attention and cognitive attention comes back to that visual target over and over again it's a deliberate process of bringing your attention back to a particular location that is very valuable for improving your levels of focus in fact it is known to create significant improvements in your ability to focus which is critical for your ability to study and learn so i know that many people are interested in what to take what to do at the level of kind of um esoteric practices or things to buy there is stuff out there again i mentioned hydration caffeine great sleep and so on but the simple practice of mindfulness meditation or just what i describe as a focusing perceptual exercise of bringing your attention back to the same location over and over again deliberately will train you to train your nervous system to bring your attention back

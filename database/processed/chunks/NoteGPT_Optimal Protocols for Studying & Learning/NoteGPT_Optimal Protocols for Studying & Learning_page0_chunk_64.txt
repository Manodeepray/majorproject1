your students or that your teacher gives you that requires you to think about the material with some degree of depth with some degree of effort and of course you're going to get certain things wrong now i would hope that if testing is being used as a learning tool as opposed to just for evaluation but here we're talking about using testing as a learning tool that it wouldn't impact at least not at that moment your final performance in the course or whatever it is rather it is testing for sake of learning learning now we know from the literature that students don't like pop quizzes i gave you a few today and forgive me they don't like pop quizzes and we know this in the form of the reduction in teaching evaluation scores okay uh having received teaching evaluation scores of different uh let's say values over the years and i always take the feedback seriously one salient comment that just leapt into my mind was the fact that i end up mentioning my bulldog costello too often in class so here i'm mentioning him again just to get back at that one student that said i mention too much i'll mention him as much as i want the point here is that when students evaluate their teachers they tend to punish their teachers for pop quizzes does that mean pop quizzes aren't effective no but you know what's more effective telling students at the outset of class or telling yourself at the outset of any kind of learning expedition because this isn't just about the classroom that you're going to take a bunch of exams that you're going to use testing or quizzes whatever you want to call them as a form of teaching and learning

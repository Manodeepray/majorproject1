new material taking more tests on that material even if you don't perform that well on those tests as long as you're able to see the accurate answers to those tests and compare your answers to those answers will lead to better performance on the ultimate test and retention of that material at some later time put differently it's not about how many times you study the material or how many times you're exposed to the material it's about being exposed to the material doing your best to focus and attend to that material and then self- testing yourself on that material or as the case may be if an an instructor is the one giving you the test but nonetheless taking tests on that material not just once but ideally two or three times that's what really locks the material into your neural circuits that's what's going to lead to the most pervasive change the most durable change we should say in your neural circuits that carry that material that hold that material in your mind what we call neural encoding okay so the the more times you test yourself or that you are tested on material the better your retention of that material now some people will immediately say well goodness what if i learned it and then i'm tested and i'm somehow consolidating the wrong or inaccurate material but it doesn't appear to be the case as long as you learn what the correct answers to the tests are even if you're getting you know 40 or 50 or less accurate on those tests that you take immediately after the studying period that's still going to be a better strategy than rereading the material which ought to be somewhat surprising it certainly was surprising to me but

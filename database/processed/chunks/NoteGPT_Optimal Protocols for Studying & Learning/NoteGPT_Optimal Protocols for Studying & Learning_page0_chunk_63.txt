first blush look like the right answer and people have a tendency to circle those and move on or to select those and move on but if you think about the material a little more deeply turns out those quote unquote obvious answers are actually the incorrect answers so there are versions of multiple choice tests where it requires a greater degree of mastery of the material where simple familiarity won't serve you and you actually have to be able to recall the different components of information leading into that but those are a bit more rare certainly in the context of other kinds of learning like musical learning although i suppose for music theory that could be relevant but when i say music learning i'm just kind of fating to the idea of the mechanics of musical learning but of course there's music theory etc so what i'm effectively saying is the ultimate exam the final exam the midterm exam the exam that's administered to you rarely do you have control over the format of that exam sometimes it's mixed format but the different ways in which you self- test as a form of studying are really key and ideally you would make these open-ended in other words you would not simply rely on multiple choice you would rely on a form of self- testing or that you give your students or that your teacher gives you that requires you to think about the material with some degree of depth with some degree of effort and of course you're going to get certain things wrong now i would hope that if testing is being used as a learning tool as opposed to just for evaluation but here we're talking about using testing as a learning tool that it wouldn't

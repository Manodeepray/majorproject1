to teach others in the same course okay you can probably think of a few others now why are we taking these silly little quizzes well turns out they're not so silly when one considers that hopefully you'll remember the information from today so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again but that if ever there was a strongly research supported tool in the literature in the peer-reviewed literature about how students can learn information better it's testing and i know i know i know we think of tests as a way to evaluate our knowledge but it turns out that testing is one of the best ways to build our knowledge to retain our knowledge and again to offset forgetting now the study of testing as a learning tool not just as a way to evaluate how much information we've learned goes back over a hundred years there's a classic study that was done in 1917 where grade school age children read biographies so they read biographies and then the kids were divided into different groups one group read and reread and reread those biographies over and over another group read the biographies once and then were tested on those biographies but get this they tested themselves on those biographies simply by having to think about the information that they had read and trying to remember the information like what was the biography who was the person who are they married to what did they do when did they go to school what did they do in school what did they do in the world what role did they play in life so they essentially tested their own knowledge simply by going into their own head and asking themselves what they could remember about

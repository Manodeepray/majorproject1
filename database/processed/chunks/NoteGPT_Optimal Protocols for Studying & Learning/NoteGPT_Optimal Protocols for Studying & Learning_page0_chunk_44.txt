six months or even tomorrow they report that is the students in the study test test test group report much lower confidence in the material much lower sense of mastery of the material compared to the students that were exposed to the material four times who are saying yeah i think i would do pretty well or very well and guess what the exact opposite is true put differently when you're exposed to material over and over and over again you think you've learned the material in fact your confidence that you've learned the material increases with each subsequent exposure to the material but actually you haven't learned it at all compared to the people that are exposed to the material and then take tests on the material often times straining to get the answers right on those tests in fact sometimes getting those answers dead wrong and then realizing they get those answers dead wrong or sometimes they just sense it but guess what testing yourself once twice maybe three times prior to the ultimate test of your knowledge of that material is far and away the best way to lock that material into those neural circuits now i say i wish i had learned this when i was a student because to some extent i used a self- testing approach the one most salan example of that is i took a course when i was in college i still remember it was bioscience's 169 l neuroanatomy laboratory taught by ben ree he's still there i believe and he was known then and i'm sure still now if he's still teaching as extremely challenging professor extremely challenging not as a person not as personality but a ton of detail and rigor and high high high expectation for this laboratory

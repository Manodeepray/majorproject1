undergo which are reflective of neuroplasticity okay so the answer to question was is that there are three different modes of neuroplasticity as you recall or as you may not have been able to recall and by the way if you were not able to recall the three different modes of neuroplasticity or mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity that is fine as you'll soon realize recognizing the errors in your information retention is another critical and very useful way to retain more information even if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know in fact especially if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know so the three ways are the strengthening of neural connection second the weakening of neural connections and third through neurogenesis the addition of new neurons why did i provide this quiz why did i test you well as you'll soon learn if you look across the total body of research on how best to study and learn it involves doing exactly what we just did which is to periodically stop and test yourself on the material that you learned testing is not just a way of evaluating what knowledge you've acquired and which knowledge you have not managed to acquire it also turns out to be the best tool for offsetting forgetting of any kind and i'll go into the data that supports that statement in a moment so yes today we're going to get a little bit meta in the sense that we're going to be learning about optimal studying strategies and applying those as we go through this podcast and no there will not be a test at the end although you're welcome to give yourself a test at the end i'm going to provide you with an excellent zeroc cost very fast

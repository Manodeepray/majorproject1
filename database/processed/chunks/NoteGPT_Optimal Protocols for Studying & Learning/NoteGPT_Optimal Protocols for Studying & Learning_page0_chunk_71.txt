there's things like emdr there are pharmacologic approaches some of these are combined with the sorts of things i've described i've done entire episodes about stress and ptsd again you can find those at hubman lab.com by putting stress ptsd into the search function however we know that it is the same neuromodulators mainly epinephrine and norepinephrine deployed at massive amounts in those moments where something very stressful happens that allows the neural circuits that led up to the circumstance as well as the neural circuits that encode that visual scene and scenes like it or sounds like it to be locked in and linked to the stress response now what this is really all saying is that negative stuff is remembered typically the first time and every time and very durably over time as compared to positive experiences which as far as peak experiences go right birth of your first child a wedding a wonderful um professional or person experience those two can be one trial learning and memory but most things that we are exposed to are not at those extremes either negative or positive however we know that any kind of story any kind of emotional emphasis on material either in the delivery of that material but certainly in the way that that material is perceived by you like getting really excited about something you want to learn or thinking something's really awful is likely to be more readily and stably committed to your memory and that's because of these neuromodulators like epinephrine and norepinephrine but other neuromodulators as well that wire those experiences into your neural circuits again these neuromodulators epinephrine norepinephrine we also hear about acetycholine dopamine etc they can operate at low levels and sort of background levels they can create subtle fluctuations and

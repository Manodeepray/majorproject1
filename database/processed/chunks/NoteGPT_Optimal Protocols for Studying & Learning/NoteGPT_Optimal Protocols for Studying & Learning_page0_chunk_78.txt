all the moves it's all scripted into their nervous system and they can deploy those at any time so they have real mastery but in order to display their incredible abilities their virtuosity they actively invite in the x factor the uncertainty such that sometimes they find themselves playing their instrument or singing or performing athletically or mathematically or what have you in way that even surprise them and that of course is a lot to expect of ourselves i think most of us would be uh content to have skill and mastery of the things that we care about and you know should we achieve virtuosity then wonderful but one of the main points of today's discussion was to arm you with an understanding of neuroplasticity in the context of studying and learning to really understand that so much of learning stably and consolidating information over time is to offset the forgetting process and that testing is not just a tool for evaluating our knowledge but rather a tool for evaluating and reinforcing and building our knowledge put differently that testing is an excellent tool if not the best tool for studying and i think that's an important reframe that others have brought about and that i really want to highlight underline and bold face during today's discussion it's one that i certainly wish i had applied more in my educational trajectory and it's one that i plan to deploy further in my seeking out of new knowledge in terms of the podcast and neuroscience but in other areas of my life as well because from the existing literature and hopefully from the way it was presented to you today you probably realize that it is near infinite if not infinite that we can apply testing as a tool

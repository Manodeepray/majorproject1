or perhaps another example would be somebody gives you a lecture about a particular phase in history and then you're not being exposed to the material again and you're not self- testing versus if you just take one test even a self-directed test of the material immediately after irrespective of how well you perform you have the amount of forgetting okay i want you to think about self testing in this way because we're thinking about optimal studying strategies you have the amount of forgetting that would normally occur this is oh so important in fact i don't even know that most neuroscientists think about learning and neuroplasticity this way most everybody including neuroscientists are taught we taught continue to be taught that you're exposed to new material you focus okay then during sleep there's remodeling of the connections all that's true but we really need to think about how most information that comes into our nervous system each day is forgotten most of it is completely discarded there are some rare clinical deficits where people remember everything and i'll tell you these people really struggle in life they do not do well in work in relationships they remember every little detail of everything and it is incredibly disruptive to their quality of life it's nothing you want you want to have a great memory for the right things so when you self test material you have the amount of forgetting that occurs compared to if you're just exposed to the material i want you to keep that fact in mind because that fact is the one that really hit me upside the head and made me realize goodness gracious how i wish that i'd self- tested myself on material that i wanted to remember over time rather than reading

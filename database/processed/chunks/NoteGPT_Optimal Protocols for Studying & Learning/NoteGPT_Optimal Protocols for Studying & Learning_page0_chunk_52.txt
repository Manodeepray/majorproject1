long delay then a test and then the ultimate test okay the test that everybody takes at the same time can you guess which group performed best and the essence of this experiment if you're listening to this and it's not clear in your mind is you're either expose to the material and test it very soon after and then take a test after a delay say a week or two weeks later or you're exposed the material there's a delay of a few days then you take a test and then another few days and then you take a test so it's more evenly spaced or if you were assigned to the third group you'd study you're not going to see the material or be tested on it until a day or two before the big test then you're tested on it you get your answers back and then you're tested on it again you could imagine that the last group might perform best because they're reexposed to the material they're told what the correct answers are so they know what they got wrong they know what they got right and then the next day they're taking the test again i would have thought that group would perform best but it turns out the opposite is true it's pretty wild the best performance comes from being exposed to material what in this experiment they're called studying okay so they read a passage or they learn some math material or language material or music material or motor learning then they take a test very soon after even same day or next day and then there's a long delay and then they take the test that group performs best put differently test yourself very soon if not the same day certainly

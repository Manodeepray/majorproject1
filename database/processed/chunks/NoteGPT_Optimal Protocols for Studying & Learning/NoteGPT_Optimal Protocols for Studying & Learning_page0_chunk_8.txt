that have not heard those discussions this will be thorough enough for you to be able to digest all the rest of today's information neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of your nervous system which of course includes your brain and your spinal cord which is the ability for your nervous system to change in response to experience so any form of learning involves neuroplasticity neuroplasticity we sometimes hear as neural plasticity two words or neuroplasticity those are the same thing essentially the change that underlies neuroplasticity at the level of cells which we call neurons or nerve cells generally involves three different mechanisms one is the strengthening of certain connections what we call synaptic connections synapses are the location between neurons where they communicate with one another it's actually a gap between the neurons it is technically called the synaptic left it's a gap and within that gap chemicals are passed across that gap that allow one neuron to activate other neurons or many neurons to activate many other neurons or to inhibit the activity of other neurons okay so one form of neuroplasticity is the strengthening of connections between neurons another form of neuroplasticity is the weakening of connections between neurons and yet a third form of plasticity which is often discussed in the media but is very rare actually in the nervous system especially the adult nervous system of humans is neurogenesis or the addition of new neurons let's just get this out of the way up front because the addition of new neurons again grabs so much attention in media articles but it's responsible for a near trivial amount of the sort of neuroplasticity that is important for today's discussion or frankly for most all discussions it is true you have a specialized set of neurons in

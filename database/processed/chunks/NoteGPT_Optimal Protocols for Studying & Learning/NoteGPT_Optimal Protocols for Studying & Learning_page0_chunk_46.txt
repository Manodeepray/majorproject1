the dissection we dissected a sheep brain at that time um so we're literally dissecting an actual brain we're doing microscope work we're learning about it from the textbook and from lecture and there was a ton of new nomenclature about rostral codal dorsal vent all the stuff of neuron anatomy and then at some point i made the decision perhaps on the basis of sheer overwhelm to study for neuron anatomy by laying down on my bed in my studio apartment i lived alone and closing my eyes and flying through the nervous system from different entry points through the ear review my coar anatomy through the eye review my retinal anatomy through the dorsal surface of the brain think about the susai and gyri and then the corpus colossum and then i got and and i can still see it in my mind's eye so my process of studying for neuroanatomy yes involved exposure to the material but it involved hours upon hours of thinking about the material within my own brain so it's a little bit meta unto itself there as a consequence i like to think in fact i believe um with some confidence that i have uh very high mastery of neuroanatomy in different species as well now that's my particular area of expertise i don't think i'm any kind of savant with respect to neuro anatomy i just spent hours upon hours learning the material and then reviewing the material within my mind so in other words testing myself here's what i would do if i were moving down a trajectory of a of a neural tract for instance between say the the hippocampus and a neighboring structure and i didn't know what was next i would then go look it up in the

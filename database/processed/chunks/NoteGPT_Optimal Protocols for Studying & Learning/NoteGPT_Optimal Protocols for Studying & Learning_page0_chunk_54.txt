kindergarten i wish iid learned this test yourself on the material that you were just exposed to very soon after your first exposure to it because that offsets the natural forgetting of new material that the brain is exposed to this is absolutely the hallmark of all the impressive data about testing as a tool for learning testing oneself or your students or being tested if you're the student by your teacher as a tool not just for evaluating performance for knowing what you know and don't know but for consolidating that information in your neural circuits and when i say consolidating that information in your neural circuits i realize it's a mouthful what we know is that this business of putting the testing soon after exposure to new material is about offsetting the forgetting of that material so you might say wait if that's true how come studying the material and then waiting and then then taking two tests right back to back where you're learning the material again during the test that should be the best performing group ah well there seems to be something fundamentally different about first exposure to material versus testing yourself on that material and we don't know exactly what that is there's some interesting neural imaging data in humans that this has to do something with this notion of familiarity with material this is very simple so this is easy to understand even though it involves a little bit of memory neuroscience nomenclature familiarity with something recognizing it is not the same thing as having agility with that thing of having mastery of that thing is not the same thing as having mastery of the material of having committed it to memory okay so when you read something over and over and over

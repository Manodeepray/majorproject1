you can attend so you can pay attention to the material you're trying to learn and then testing yourself later and of course the other component which is getting sufficient amounts of great sleep each night and i highly recommend doing nsdr i mentioned gap effects before those are very very cool i just used another one now and the final tool for studying that i believe is not discuss enough and is a bit counterintuitive so it's a fun one to just mention and that perhaps you can explore in your own studying and learning adventures is interleaving of information this one's kind of wild actually turns out that if your instructor or you takes information about something that they're trying to teach you or you're trying to learn maybe it's piano know maybe it's neuroscience maybe it's how to learn better and every once in a while throws in a little anecdote about something let's just say or mention something about the olympics or incorporate something that seems pseudo random because it's not actually related to the material you're trying to learn turns out that that acts not as a gap in the same sense that gap effects which are times in which you do nothing in order to get more repetitions of the material you just heard in your hippocampus but rather those breaks of interleaving information not just getting a steady barrage like drinking from a fire hose of new information from start to finish turn out to enhance overall learning ability probably we think at a mechanistic level because the neural circuits are able to generate more repetition similar to gap effects but actually in a very interesting way also because by injecting other information that seems totally unrelated random or pseudo random it allows

right because it was think about it as ssss so study study study study and then later test or sss t study study study test and then later test or sttt study test test test and then later test so what's compared and contrasted is performance on the test some period of time later now some experiments made that final test of the material a couple days later other experiments made it a couple weeks later other experiments made it much later month or even a year later okay the point here is twofold first of all based on everything i've told you thus far you can probably guess who performed best on the test that occurred some period of time later okay right the performance on that final test was essentially proportional to the number ofest one had already taken on the material okay that should be pretty much obvious given the way we've been going today in this description of tests as a way to offset forgetting okay so the more tests that you take as a way to expose you yourself to the material the better you're going to perform on that material at some later point now of course at some point you have to be exposed to the material for the first time right that's why it's studying and learning but after one exposure to new material taking more tests on that material even if you don't perform that well on those tests as long as you're able to see the accurate answers to those tests and compare your answers to those answers will lead to better performance on the ultimate test and retention of that material at some later time put differently it's not about how many times you study the material or how

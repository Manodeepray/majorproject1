i took a course when i was in college i still remember it was bioscience's 169 l neuroanatomy laboratory taught by ben ree he's still there i believe and he was known then and i'm sure still now if he's still teaching as extremely challenging professor extremely challenging not as a person not as personality but a ton of detail and rigor and high high high expectation for this laboratory course in neuroanatomy which involved lectures it involved a neuroanatomy textbook where you'd look at you know essentially panels of different brain sections from different species different types of stains of different brain tissue mind you this is an undergraduate course and then there was a laboratory component hence the l in 169 l where you'd have to go from microscope station to microscope station identifying structures based simply on what you could see down the microscope and therefore you had to know what the stain was you know what was essentially visible to you on the slide because certain stains reveal certain things like the what we call the cell body of neurons versus the um the sort of wires what we call the axons between neurons etc etc i remember thinking this is a really hard course it was a very difficult course and my mode of studying for the course involved of course going to class doing the dissection we dissected a sheep brain at that time um so we're literally dissecting an actual brain we're doing microscope work we're learning about it from the textbook and from lecture and there was a ton of new nomenclature about rostral codal dorsal vent all the stuff of neuron anatomy and then at some point i made the decision perhaps on the basis of sheer overwhelm to study for

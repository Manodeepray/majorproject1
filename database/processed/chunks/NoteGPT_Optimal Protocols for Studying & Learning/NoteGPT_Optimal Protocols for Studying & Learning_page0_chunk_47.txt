neuro anatomy i just spent hours upon hours learning the material and then reviewing the material within my mind so in other words testing myself here's what i would do if i were moving down a trajectory of a of a neural tract for instance between say the the hippocampus and a neighboring structure and i didn't know what was next i would then go look it up in the textbook and then i'd go back to this you know mental exercise visualization type studying it really wasn't studying is the point the point is that i was testing myself i was trying to find the points in which i no longer had the knowledge to move further through in this case my mental image of the brain but through the material and this is the key aspect of testing it's not about just knowing how many things you get right how many things you get wrong it's about recognizing exactly what you know and don't know and an important component of testing is running up against those things where you say h i can't remember i don't know what comes next or i'm certain that that structure is the fimbria and then you go and you look and you go it's not the fima but guess what i'll never forget for instance the location of the habenula or what it looks like a structure which by the way since these names are kind of uh esoteric at that time we didn't know what it does it turns out it's involved in disappointment it's key to the depression circuits or the circuits that underly depression in some individuals it is um suppressed by viewing of morning sunlight we know that too and by getting too much artificial light exposure in

as well as a couple of reviews that include results from similar studies again i'm pointing to a body of research not just one study here looked at whether or not studying material four times so study study study study was better in terms of locking that information into people's minds allowing them to use that information flexibly which is an element of creativity essentially giving the mastery of the material then a different group which studied once studied the material twice studied the material three times then was tested on the material or a third group that studied material once then took one two yes three tests on the material now so what i just described was three groups all of whom read a passage this was a passage about animals about biology some other topics too in different experiments again three groups one group studies four times they study the material 1 2 3 four times then later they take a test the second group studies one two three times takes a test on that material and then later takes a test the third group studies the material once then takes three tests on the material and then later takes a test so what's analyzed and compared between these different groups is their performance on that final test okay what i put in as the fifth bin there right because it was think about it as ssss so study study study study and then later test or sss t study study study test and then later test or sttt study test test test and then later test so what's compared and contrasted is performance on the test some period of time later now some experiments made that final test of the material a couple days later other experiments

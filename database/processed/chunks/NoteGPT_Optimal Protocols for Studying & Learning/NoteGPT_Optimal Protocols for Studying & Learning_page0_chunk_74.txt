exposed to new material but guess what they were doing that many hundreds of years ago and it makes sense logically based on all our understanding of the neurobiology underlying things like ptsd underlying emotion laden memory formation and consolidation and our ability to remember things that were emotionally laden much better than things that were less emotionally laden so if you want to take a cold shower after learning some material or even better testing yourself mentally on that material while in a cold shower or cold plunge you certainly can just don't stay in there too long use best practices if you want to know what those best practices are for deliberate cold exposure you can check out our deliberate cold exposure newsletter at huberman lab.com it's completely zero cost you don't even need to sign up you simply go to newsletter in the menu tab and you can find that pdf and now because you are becoming proficient in an understanding of neuroplasticity and learning and testing and neuromodulators like epinephrine yes drinking caffeine will increase your levels of ep nephrine not strikingly so but enough that it probably helps you learn things a little bit better should you drink the coffee after listen that's getting a little bit too down in the details the most important components to learning are that you be alert so that you can attend so you can pay attention to the material you're trying to learn and then testing yourself later and of course the other component which is getting sufficient amounts of great sleep each night and i highly recommend doing nsdr i mentioned gap effects before those are very very cool i just used another one now and the final tool for studying that i believe is not discuss

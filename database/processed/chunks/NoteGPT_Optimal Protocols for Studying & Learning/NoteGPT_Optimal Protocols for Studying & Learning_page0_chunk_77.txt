of you are not students any longer although some of you are but in many ways we are all students we are all constantly being exposed to all sorts of information out in the world and goodness knows um thank goodness we don't remember it all but there is of course information that we would like to remember that we would really like to consolidate in our memory and be able to have some mastery over earlier i said i would distinguish between unskilled skilled mastery and virtuosity and i'll do that now unskilled of course means that we have limited understanding let alone um ability to use information skilled typically means we know and can recognize and use information in basic ways or even advanced ways mastery typically means that we have you know close to the full depth of knowledge in a given area and that we can use it pretty flexibly and virtuosity at least my definition of virtuosity is where we actually have such mastery of material that we can use it in ways that we still don't even know how we can use meaning that we can inject elements or we even invite elements of uncertainty and kind of spontaneity into the use of that material here i'm thinking of great musicians i'm thinking of great athletes where they know all the plays they know all the moves it's all scripted into their nervous system and they can deploy those at any time so they have real mastery but in order to display their incredible abilities their virtuosity they actively invite in the x factor the uncertainty such that sometimes they find themselves playing their instrument or singing or performing athletically or mathematically or what have you in way that even surprise them and that

even though english was their second language so talk about a challenge and um that's just one example that i can think of there are many examples of that these students students that i'm referring to in this study are not necessarily constantly thinking about how their efforts will transform themselves and their families but they certainly were able to report what it was specifically that they are seeking what they're aspiring to besides just trying to do as well as they can getting into and through medical school so the high level aspirational stuff within you whatever that is for you it's going to be highly individual is certainly important and it offers a bookend to the nuts and bolts kind of stuff that you're going to do i would hope in order to best study and learn the specific material so the specific actions that you're going to take each day to learn specific bits of information that will pull you toward those important aspirations and now again if you love the material you're learning this aspirational component is probably not as important right i can recall during university and graduate school and so on thinking oh my goodness this is like the coolest thing i've ever heard probably say that about a million different topics like oh my goodness circadian rhythms seasonal rhythms melatonin neural circuits dopamine i was just a wash with excitement about what i was learning but of course sometimes i would take a course where the material was i don't know if it was more challenging or not but i had a harder time getting engaged by the material either by virtue of how it was being taught to me or the material itself so the ability to attach to some aspirational goal

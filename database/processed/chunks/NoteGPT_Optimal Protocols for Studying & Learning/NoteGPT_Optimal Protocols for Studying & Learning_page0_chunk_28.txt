i recall times during university when i'd study between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2: a.m. i don't do that any longer but scheduling time where you know you're going to need to be focused and attending is perhaps one of the most important things toward being able to focus and attend to the material now if you're taking courses you probably are going to be a slave to the timing of the courses you aren't going to be able to tell the instructor okay listen i want you to do this course at you know 3 p.m. because that's when you learn best or at 8: a.m. because that's when you happen to be able to attend best however to the extent that you have any control over the time in which you're going to study keeping that at a regular time or times perhaps one block early in the day one block later in the day perhaps two blocks early in the day and so on is going to be beneficial it turns out that's also supported by the research literature that the brain just like with its sleep wake cycles that entrain to a regular schedule that is your brain and body get used to being active and inactive at particular times based on your exposure to sunlight your exposure to activities your social rhythms etc if you regularly meaning for the course of about three days make it a point to focus and study at particular times again pulling your attention back it's not an automatic process but pulling your attention back to a specific location perhaps on a page or that you're listening to in a lecture your body and brain will start to entrain to that rhythm such that you will be able

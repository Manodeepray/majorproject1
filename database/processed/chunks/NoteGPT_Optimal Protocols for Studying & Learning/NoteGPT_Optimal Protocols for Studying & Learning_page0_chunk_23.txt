it in the afternoon you can do it in the middle of the night if you're not able to sleep and offset some of the sleep loss that you otherwise would have experienced nsdr is a very powerful tool in order to enhance neuroplasticity and i'll talk more about this in a future episode there's a lot of exciting data coming out about nsdr and yoga nitra but if you're sleeping well and even if you aren't i highly encourage you to incorporate a 10 or 20 minute nsdr into your schedule someplace again where you place it in your schedule isn't as important as the fact that you do it in order to enhance neuroplasticity that is the reordering of connections between neurons to serve the studying and learning that you're doing now let's talk about how the best students structure their days turns out there are great studies on this there's a really nice paper in fact that surveyed close to 700 students these were medical students approximately equal number of male and female students and analyze the most useful learning habits that is the learning habits associated with the most successful students now anytime you do a study like this where people take surveys there's always the issue of causality in fact we can pretty much set aside any possible causality for instance i'm about to tell you that the very best performing students tend to study for about three or four hours per day but you could easily say well they're the best students because they study three or four hours per day they don't study three or four hours per day because they're the best students and you'd be exactly right okay we can get into all sorts of discussions about correlation versus causation about

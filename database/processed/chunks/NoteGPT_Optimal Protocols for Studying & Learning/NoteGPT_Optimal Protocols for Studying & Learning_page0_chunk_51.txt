were exposed to the material for the first time and i realize this is a little bit of a problem because we're using the word study when in fact i'm trying to make the point that testing yourself is studying okay so uh forgive me but this is the way it's mapped out in these experiments in these papers should you look them up in our show note captions one group is exposed to the material what we're call studying and then takes a test immediately after they are told what they got right what they got wrong on that test and what the correct answers are and then sometime later after a delay they take a test of the same material another group studies that is they're exposed to the material then there's a delay okay that delay could be days it could be weeks this experiment has been done every which way it seems by now then they're tested and then there's another delay and then they take a test at the same time that group one did okay so again it's study test long delay test for group one or study delay test delay test for group two remember the final test is taken at the same time by everybody or group three study that is they're exposed to the material then a long long long long long delay then a test and then the ultimate test okay the test that everybody takes at the same time can you guess which group performed best and the essence of this experiment if you're listening to this and it's not clear in your mind is you're either expose to the material and test it very soon after and then take a test after a delay say a week or

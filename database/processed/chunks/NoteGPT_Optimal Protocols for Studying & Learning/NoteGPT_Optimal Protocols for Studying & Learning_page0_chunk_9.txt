of humans is neurogenesis or the addition of new neurons let's just get this out of the way up front because the addition of new neurons again grabs so much attention in media articles but it's responsible for a near trivial amount of the sort of neuroplasticity that is important for today's discussion or frankly for most all discussions it is true you have a specialized set of neurons in your olda factory bulb that are responsible for smell as well as a specialized set of neurons in the so-called dentate gyrus of your hippocampus an area of the brain that's important for memory in which new neurons appear to be added throughout the lifespan but this is not the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans rather the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans is the strengthening of existing connections and the weakening of existing connections or the formation of new connections between already ex existing neurons not new neurons okay now the removal or weakening of connections between neurons being an important component of neuroplasticity is very important for sake of today's discussion i want to emphasize that when we hear about weakening of connections we often think well that means forgetting or that means the brain is getting less good however so much of the neuroplasticity that underlies for instance the acquisition of a new motor skill is actually the reflection of removal of connections so we don't want to project any kind of value onto a discussion about adding new connections removing new connections let's just leave it at this level mechanistically when you hear about neuroplasticity just know that it could be the consequence of strengthening of connections as well as weakening of connections and that neither strengthening

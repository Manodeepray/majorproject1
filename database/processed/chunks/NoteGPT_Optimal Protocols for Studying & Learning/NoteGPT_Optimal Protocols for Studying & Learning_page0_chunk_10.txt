the acquisition of a new motor skill is actually the reflection of removal of connections so we don't want to project any kind of value onto a discussion about adding new connections removing new connections let's just leave it at this level mechanistically when you hear about neuroplasticity just know that it could be the consequence of strengthening of connections as well as weakening of connections and that neither strengthening of connections in the nervous system nor weakening of connections can map directly to the formation or remove removal of say memories or information just know that these are the important mechanisms in fact if you look at a baby that is let's say i don't know n9 months old their motor skills are not terrific typically compared to the motor skills that that child will have when they are six or seven years old just look at a kid trying to eat spaghetti or something of that sort or eat anything when they're a small baby versus a toddler versus a young child versus an adolescent or te you know despite the um poor table manners of some adolescence and teens and some adults for that matter they are still exhibiting far more precise motor movements than they did as an infant of course and believe it or not the improvement in motor coordination that one observes in humans and other species for that matter from birth until the adolescence and teen years and adult years is largely the reflection of the removal that's right the removal of neural connections as opposed to the form of neural connections however the neural connections that remain become much more robust they become much more reliable okay so that's the mechanistic backdrop for everything that we're going to talk about today which

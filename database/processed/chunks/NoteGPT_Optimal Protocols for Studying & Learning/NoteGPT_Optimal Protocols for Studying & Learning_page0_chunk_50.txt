all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that i'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes i dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when i wake up in the morning and i drink that basically first thing in the morning i also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise i'm doing especially on hot days if i'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lm.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack okay so i like to think that we're establishing that testing yourself or testing your students or being tested by your teacher is the best way to offset forgetting let's look at the literature that actually supports that statement directly because in the previous experiment i described it was either study study study study or study study study test or study test test test and then later everybody takes a test at the same time a variant on that was done where they had one group of students study material so this is new material and when i say study i mean they were exposed to the material for the first time and i realize this is a little bit of a problem because we're using the word study when in fact i'm trying to make the point that testing yourself is studying okay so uh forgive me but this is the way it's mapped out in these experiments in these papers should you look them up in our show note captions one

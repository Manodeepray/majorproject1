behavioral tool that you can use to improve focus the answer is simple mindfulness meditation which i'd prefer you think of simply as a perceptual exercise so again just sit or lie down close your eyes focus on your breath when your attention drifts bring your attention back to your breath and so on or if you prefer you can do this eyes open by focusing on a visual target either a foot or two feet or 3 ft away whatever distance is comfortable for you allowing yourself to blink as needed but forcing yourself to focus on that visual target for say 1 to 3 minutes maybe even 3 to 5 minutes maybe even 10 minutes again please blink you don't want your eyes to dry both those tools will improve your ability to attend to focus to other material when the time comes okay the circuits for focus and attention themselves are subject to neuroplasticity and then the third question is can you name or list off in your mind three tools that the most effective students have been shown to use i can think of limiting distraction by virtue of putting away phones and telling others you won't be in contact with them two and i'm getting these out of order i realize is to isolate to study alone and the third that i can recall is to teach others in the same course okay you can probably think of a few others now why are we taking these silly little quizzes well turns out they're not so silly when one considers that hopefully you'll remember the information from today so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again but that if ever there was a strongly research supported tool in the literature

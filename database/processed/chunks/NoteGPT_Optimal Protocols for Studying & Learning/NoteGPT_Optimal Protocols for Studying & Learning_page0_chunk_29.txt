if you regularly meaning for the course of about three days make it a point to focus and study at particular times again pulling your attention back it's not an automatic process but pulling your attention back to a specific location perhaps on a page or that you're listening to in a lecture your body and brain will start to entrain to that rhythm such that you will be able to focus and attend better simply by virtue of the regularity of the timing of the exposure to the material okay so you probably need about two or three days to break into a regular schedule of focusing and attending and studying at a given time or times allow yourself that transition period but then make it a point to schedule those times to study set aside your phone tell people you're going offline turn off the wi-fi if you need to or have to you may need it for your studying i don't know depends on what you're studying but limit distractions at all costs and learn to just focus on the material and this is a skill this is the most important thing to understand it's a skill to be able to focus and study and it's a skill that you can learn very quickly especially if you schedule it for regular times and you give yourself two or three days in which to adapt to those schedules and times and then try and stick to them as regularly as possible perhaps even on the weekends if you're approaching you know the end of the quarter or semester perhaps even on the weekend even if you're not in the quarter or semester keeping those regular times will entrain your nervous system to study and learn at its best

and other species for that matter from birth until the adolescence and teen years and adult years is largely the reflection of the removal that's right the removal of neural connections as opposed to the form of neural connections however the neural connections that remain become much more robust they become much more reliable okay so that's the mechanistic backdrop for everything that we're going to talk about today which is how to study and learn and as i mentioned earlier in my introduction most of learning and remembering new material is about offsetting the forgetting process that naturally occurs any time we hear new information so in keeping with what will ultimately reveal itself to be the dominant theme of today's discussion right now and for reasons that will become clear later i want you to take a brief quiz now the moment people hear quiz or test typically it spikes their adrenaline they start feeling stressed but don't worry you're going to keep your answers to yourself and you're doing this for a very specific purpose here's my question this is a two question quiz how many different ways mechanistically speaking does does neuroplasticity occur is it one mechanism two mechanisms or three mechanisms or is it four or five okay can you name in your head two of the three major changes that the nervous system can undergo which are reflective of neuroplasticity okay so the answer to question was is that there are three different modes of neuroplasticity as you recall or as you may not have been able to recall and by the way if you were not able to recall the three different modes of neuroplasticity or mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity that is fine as you'll soon realize recognizing the errors in your information retention

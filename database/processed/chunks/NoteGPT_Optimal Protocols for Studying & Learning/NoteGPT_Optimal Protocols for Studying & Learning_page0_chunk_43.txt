material but it doesn't appear to be the case as long as you learn what the correct answers to the tests are even if you're getting you know 40 or 50 or less accurate on those tests that you take immediately after the studying period that's still going to be a better strategy than rereading the material which ought to be somewhat surprising it certainly was surprising to me but you know what's even more surprising and a little scary and that we all should know and i wish i had learned when i was like in the second grade is that if you ask students how confident are you in the material that you just learned how well do you think you would perform on a test what you see consistently in these studies i'm chuckling because it's kind of mindblowing is that the students who study the the material that is who were exposed to the material four times think that they are going to perform best on the ultimate exam however the students that study the material once and then are tested three times on that material they think that ultimately they're going to perform least well for instance they ask them their confidence how well do you think he would perform on a test of this material in two weeks or in a year or in six months or even tomorrow they report that is the students in the study test test test group report much lower confidence in the material much lower sense of mastery of the material compared to the students that were exposed to the material four times who are saying yeah i think i would do pretty well or very well and guess what the exact opposite is true put differently when

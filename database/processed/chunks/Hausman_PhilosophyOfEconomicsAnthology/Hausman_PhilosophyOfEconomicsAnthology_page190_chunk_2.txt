approximates them to make their postulation interesting. letmepropose a methodological principle to replace the principle of unreality. i should like to call it the principle of continuity of approxima-tion. it asserts: if the conditions of the real world approximate sufcientlywell the assumptions of an ideal type, the derivations from these assump- tions will be approximately correct. failure to incorporate this principle intohis formulation seems to me a major weakness in the interesting approachof professor papandreous paper. unreality of premises is not a virtue inscientic theory; it is a necessary evil a concession to the nite computingcapacity of the scientist that is made tolerable by the principle of continuityof approximation. working scientists employ the principle of continuity all the time. unfor- tunately, it has no place in modern statistical theory. the word signicanthas been appropriated by the statisticians to mean unlikely to have arisenbychance. now, in testing extreme hypotheses ideal types we do not primarily want to know whether there are deviations of observation fromtheory which are signicant in this sense. it is far more important to knowwhether they are signicant in the sense that the approximation of theorytoreality is beyond the limits of our tolerance. until this latter notion of

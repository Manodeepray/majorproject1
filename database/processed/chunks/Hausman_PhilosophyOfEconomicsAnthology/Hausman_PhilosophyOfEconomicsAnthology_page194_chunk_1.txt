(trivially from 2 prime) presumably nobody believes 3.3what is wrong with the argument? it assumes that a road test is a conclusive test of a cars future performance. ifthis assumption were true, if it were possible (and cheap) to do a total check of the performance of a used car for the whole of its future, then there would indeed be no point in looking under the hood. for we would know everything about its performance, which is all we care about. but a road test only provides a small sample of this performance. thus a mechanic who examines the engine can provide relevant and useful information. themechanics input is particularly important when one wants to use the carunder new circumstances and when the car breaks down. obviously onewants a sensible mechanic who notes not just that the components are usedand imperfect, but who can judge how well the components are likely toserve their separate purposes. similarly, given friedmans view of the goal of science, there would be no point in examining the assumptions of a theory if it were possible to do atotal assessment of its performance with respect to the phenomena it was designed to explain. but one cannot make such an assessment. indeed, thepoint of a theory is to guide us in circumstances where we do not alreadyknow whether the predictions are correct. 4there is thus much that may be learned by examining the components (assumptions) of a theory and itsirrelevant predictions. such consideration of the realism of assumptionsis particularly important when extending the theory

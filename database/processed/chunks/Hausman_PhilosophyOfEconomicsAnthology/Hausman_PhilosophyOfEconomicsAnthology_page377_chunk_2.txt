one can extrapolate statistically fromthe correlation between ofc activation and in normal subjects to infer the behavioural value of that would be revealed by choices of aperson with no ofc activity at all due to a lesion in that area, say (see figure 19.2). the extrapolated estimate is 0.85 (roughly ambiguity-neutral, given sampling error). in fact, hsu etal.also tested ellsberg-type problems on patients with ofc damage subsuming theareas observed in fmri. those patients choices exhibited a value of 0.82. i would love to say this value was truly predicted before the fact, but it was not (both studies were conducted in parallel). inany case, there is a close link between the behavioural parameter pre-dicted by extrapolating from the fmri evidence to patients with noactivity, and the extrapolated parameter is close to the gure revealedbychoices. while this correspondence could be construed as consistent with axiomatic theories of ambiguity-aversion, no theory would have predicted it without the fmri evidence to tell us what lesion patientswould be roughly ambiguity-neutral. 2. wang etal.(2006) studied experimentally a classic biased- transmission game that has been widely used in economics and

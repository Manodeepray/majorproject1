(the parameter is derived implicitly from the weight (e(p) )given to an event with expected or diffuse- prior probability p. the value 1isambiguity-neutrality. a value 1corresponds to ambiguity-aversion; an ambiguity-averse per- son acts as if the decision weight on an ambiguous event is lowerthan its expected probability.) one can extrapolate statistically fromthe correlation between ofc activation and in normal subjects to infer the behavioural value of that would be revealed by choices of aperson with no ofc activity at all due to a lesion in that area, say (see figure 19.2). the extrapolated estimate is 0.85 (roughly ambiguity-neutral, given sampling error). in fact, hsu etal.also tested ellsberg-type problems on patients with ofc damage subsuming theareas observed in

of expectations. he notes, further, that the formation of expectations may depend upon peoples understanding of the causal struc- ture of the economy in general and of the process of policy formation inparticular. this is why the rational expectations hypothesis is often linkedwith the lucas critique. the important point about the analysis of non- invariance provided by haavelmo and simon is to remind us that rationalexpectations is simply one means by which causal relations may be linked; and, in general, it is the omission of any causal relation related to those remaining that produces non-invariance. 4lucas and his predecessors have, then, diagnosed a problem for economic analysis. we must now turn toproposed cures. 3. strategies for securing invariance apriorism the invariance problem can be treated in two complementary ways: as aproblem of representing causal relations or as a problem of identiability.indiscussing the problem of securing identication, econometric textbooks recommend that restrictions be imposed a priori on the basis of economic theory. 5thus, the second approach explains why the most frequently pro- posed strategy for securing invariance in econometric models subject to the

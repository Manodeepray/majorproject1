between the variables or entities in themodel and observable phenomena. these two parts are very different in character. the model is abstract and complete; it is an algebra or logic. mathematics and formal logic come into their own in checking its consistency and completeness and exploringits implications. there is no place in the model for, and no function to beserved by, vagueness, maybes, or approximations. the air pressure is zero,not small, for a vacuum; the demand curve for the product of a competitiveproducer is horizontal (has a slope of zero), not almost horizontal. the rules for using the model, on the other hand, cannot possibly be abstract and complete. they must be concrete and in consequence incom-plete completeness is possible only in a conceptual world, not in the realworld, however that may be interpreted. the model is the logical embod- iment of the half-truth, there is nothing new under the sun; the rulesfor applying it cannot neglect the equally signicant half-truth, historynever repeats itself. t o a considerable extent the rules can be formulatedexplicitly most easily, though even then not completely, when the theory is part of an explicit more general theory as in the example of the vacuumtheory for falling bodies. in seeking to mak eascience as objective as pos- sible, our aim should be to formulate the rules explicitly in so far as possibleand continually to widen the range of phenomena for which it is possibletodo so. but, no matter how successful we may be in this attempt, there

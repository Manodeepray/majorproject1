wemean (what has commonly been meant) reasoning from an assumed hypothesis; which is not a practice conned to mathematics, butis of the essence of all science which admits of general reasoning at all. t overify the hypothesis itself aposteriori ,that is, to examine whether the facts of any actual case are in accordance with it, is no part of the business ofscience at all, but of the application of science. inthe denition which we have attempted to frame of the science of polit- ical economy, we have characterized it as essentially an abstract science, and its method as the method ap riori.s u c hi s undoubtedly its character as it has been understood and taught by all its most distinguished teachers. it reasons,and, as we contend, must necessarily reason, from assumptions, not fromfacts. it is built upon hypotheses, strictly analogous to those which, under thename of denitions, are the foundation of the other abstract sciences. geom-etry presupposes an arbitrary denition of a line, that which has length butnot breadth. just in the same manner does political economy presupposean arbitrary denition of man, as a being who invariably does that by whichhe may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxu-ries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained in the existing state of knowledge. it is true that thisdenition of man is not formally prexed to any work on political economy,as the denition of a line is prexed to euclids elements; and in propor-tion as by being so prexed it would be less in danger of being forgotten,

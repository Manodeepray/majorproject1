no such thing as an exception. what is thought to be anexception to a principle is always some other and distinct principle cutting into the former: some other force which impinges against the rst force,and deects it from its direction. there are not a lawand an exception to that law the law acting in ninety-nine cases, and the exception in one.there are two laws, each possibly acting in the whole hundred cases, andbringing about a common effect by their conjunct operation. if the forcewhich, being the less conspicuous of the two, is called the disturbing force,prevails sufciently over the other force in some one case, to constitutethat case what is commonly called an exception, the same disturbing forceprobably acts as a modifying cause in many other cases which no one willcall exceptions. thus if it were stated to be a law of nature, that all heavy bodies fall to the ground, it would probably be said that the resistance of the atmosphere,which prevents a balloon from falling, c onstitutes the balloon an exception tothat pretended law of nature. but the real law is, that all i heavy bodies tend tofall; and to this there is no exception, not even the sun and moon; for even they, as every astronomer knows, tend towards the earth, withforce exactly equal to that with which the earth tends towards them. theresistance of the atmosphere might, in the particular case of the balloon, from a misapprehension of what the law of gravitation is, be said to prevail over the law; but its disturbing effect is quite as real in every other case, since

all have to speak ofthe assumptions of a theory and to compare the assumptions of alternativetheories. there is too much smoke for there to be no re. inmethodology, as in positive science, negative statements can generally be made with greater condence than positive statements, so i have less con-dence in the following remarks on the signicance and role of assumptionsthan in the preceding remarks. so far as i can see, the assumptions of a the-ory play three different, though related, positive roles: ( a)they are often an economical mode of describing or presenting a theory; ( b)they some- times facilitate an indirect test of the hypothesis by its implications; and(c), as already noted, they are sometimes a convenient means of specifying the conditions under which the theory is expected to be valid. the rst tworequire more extensive discussion. a.the use of assumptions in stating a theory the example of the leaves illustrates the rst role of assumptions. instead of saying that leaves seek to maximize the sunlight they receive, we couldstate the equivalent hypothesis, without any apparent assumptions, in theform of a list of rules for predicting the density of leaves: if a tree stands inalevel eld with no other trees or other bodies obstructing the rays of the

of being consistent with the nite evidence. the choiceamong alternative hypotheses equally consistent with the available evidencemust to some extent be arbitrary, though there is general agreement that relevant considerations are suggested by the criteria simplicity and fruit- fulness, themselves notions that defy completely objective specication. atheory is simpler the less the initial knowledge needed to make a predic-tion within a given eld of phenomena; it is more fruitful the more precisethe resulting prediction, the wider the area within which the theory yieldspredictions, and the more additional lines for further research it suggests.logical completeness and consistency are relevant but play a subsidiary role;their function is to assure that the hypothesis says what it is intended to sayand does so alike for all users they play the same role here as checks forarithmetical accuracy do in statistical computations. unfortunately, we can seldom test particular predictions in the social sciences by experiments explicitly designed to eliminate what are judged tobe the most important disturbing inuences. generally, we must rely onevidence cast up by the experiments that happen to occur. the inability toconduct so-called controlled experiments does not, in my view, reect abasic difference between the social and physical sciences both because it is not peculiar to the social sciences witness astronomy and because thedistinction between a controlled exper iment and uncontrolled experience is

ogether (e.g. an increase in well-being, other things being equal, will involve a higher agency achievement). in addition,afailure to achieve ones non-well-being objectives may also cause frustration, thereby reducing ones well-being. these and other connections exist between well-being and agency, but they do not make the two concepts congruent nor isomorphic in the sense of generating the same orderings. similarly, morefreedom (either to have well-being or to achieve ones agency goals) may leadone to end up achieving more (respectively, of well-being or of agency success),but it is also possible for freedom to go up while achievement goes down, andvice ver sa. we have here four interdependent butnon-identical concepts. these distinctions and their inter-relations are discussed more fully in sen ( 1985 a, 1992 ). 18.see adam smith ( 1776 :vol. ii, bk v , ch. 2 (section on taxes upon consumable commodities)), in campbell and skinner ( 1976 ), 46971. 19.rock edicts xiii at erragudi, statement vii. for a translation and discussion, see sircar ( 1979 :34). 20.this view may be disputed by considering a different way of drawing the linebetween well-being and living standards. one common approach is to relate theassessment of living standards only to real incomes and to economic or mate-rial causes. on this see a. c. pigou ( 1920 ); and on the conceptual differences see bernard williams ( 1987 ). but the pigovian view has problems of its own. forexample, if one has a disability that makes one get very little out of material income or wealth, or if ones life is shattered by an inconvenient and incurableillness (e.g. kidney problems requiring extensive dialysis), it is hard to claim thatones standard of living is high just because one is well heeled. i have discussedthis question and related matters in sen ( 1987 b:269, 10910). 21.forformal

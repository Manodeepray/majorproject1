was simply repeated. franklin ( 1990 ,p.1078) makes this point by noting that if you want to know the correct time, it is more informative to compare your watch withanothers than for either of you to look at your own watch twice. intuitively,experimentalists and editors apply this principle in rejecting routine pure replication as not sufciently original. experimentalists and other economists often use the rhetoric of falsify- ing theories, but it is clear from the totality of our professional conduct thatfalsication is just a means to a different end: the modication of theory inthe light of evidence. t o pursue this end, we need to know not only the con-ditions under which extant theory is falsied, but also the conditions underwhich it is veried. it is naive to suppose that any experiment will deliverthe death blow to some theory. theory always swims in the rough waterof anomaly. y ou dont abandon a theory because of a (or many) falsifyingobservation(s). when newton published the principia ,itwas well-known that he could not even account for the orbit of the moon. einsteins famouspaper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies ( annalen der physik ,17, 1905) was refuted within a year by kaufman (in the same journal) whose-ray experiments showed that the deviations from the predictions of the theory were considerably beyond the limits of error that could be attributedtohis equipment. einstein agreed, but rationalized: only after a diverse body of observations becomes available will it be possible to decide with

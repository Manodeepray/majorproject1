consistent utility function. in addi-tion, the neoclassical economists assumed that consumers are generally notsatiated that they will always prefer a bundle xof commodities or services toanother bundle yifxis unambiguously larger than y.nonsatiation is both aplausible rst approximation, and it articulates the notion of self-interest. all that matters to agents are the bundles of commodities and services thatthey are giving up or receiving. with the addition of one more generalization, one has the core of mod- ern economic theory. the early neoclassical economists noted that as oneconsumes more of any commodity or service, each additional unit increases ones utility at a diminishing rate. ones rst computer may raise ones utilityconsiderably. a second computer doesnt contribute nearly as much. this law of diminishing marginal utility explains why the price of essential butplentiful commodities such as water is lower than the price of inessential butscare commodities such as diamonds. thinking in terms of marginal utilityalso enables one to give an integrated account of the forces affecting bothdemand and supply. instead of regarding costs as reecting physical require-ments, most neoclassical theorists take costs to be the disutilities incurredwhen individuals devote resources or service to production or to be theutilities that would result from alternative uses of resources that individu-als forgo (although these are in turn inuenced by technical factors). the

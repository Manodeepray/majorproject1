(sen, 1980 ), the use of the approach, if successful for equality, need not be conned to equality only.46the usability of the approach in egalitarian calculus depends on the plausibility of seeing indi- vidual advantages in terms of capabilities, and if that plausibility is accepted, then the same general perspective can be seen to be relevant for other typesof social evaluation and aggregation. the potentially wide relevance of the capability perspective should not come as a surprise, since the capability approach is concerned with showing the cogency of a particular space for the evaluation of individual opportu- nities and successes. in any social calculus in which individual advantagesare constitutively important, that space is of potential signicance. notes 1.this was in a tanner lecture given at stanford university in may 1979 (equality of what?), later published as sen ( 1980 ). the case for focusing on capability was introduced here in the specic context of evaluating inequality. i have triedtoexplore the possibility of using the capability perspective for analysing other social issues, such as well-being and poverty (sen, 1982 a,1983 c,1985 b), liberty and freedom (sen, 1983 a,1988 a,1992 ), living standards and development (sen, 1983 b,1984 ,1987 b,1988 b), gender bias and sexual divisions (kynch and sen, 1983 ;s e n , 1985 c,1990 b), and justice and social ethics (sen, 1982 b,1985 a,1990 a). 2.though at the time of proposing the approach, i did not manage to seize its aris-totelian connections, it is interesting to note that the greek word dunamin ,used byaristotle to discuss an aspect of the human good, which is sometimes trans- lated as potentiality , can be translated also as capability of existing

(2) howvaluable are the respective objects? even though formally the former question is an elementary aspect of the latter (in the sense that the objects of value are those that have positiveweights), nevertheless the identication of the objects of value is substantively the primary exercise which makes it possible to pursue the second question. furthermore, the very identication of the set of value-objects, with pos- itive weights, itself precipitates a dominance ranking ( xis at least as high as yif it yields at least as much of each of the valued objects). this dominance ranking, which can be shown to have standard regularity properties such as transitivity, can indeed take us some distance often quite a long distance in the evaluative exercise. 6 the identication of the objects of v alue species what may be called anevaluative space. instandard utilitarian analysis, for example, the eval- uative space consists of the individual utilities (dened in the usual termsof pleasures, happiness, or desire fullment). indeed, a complete evaluative

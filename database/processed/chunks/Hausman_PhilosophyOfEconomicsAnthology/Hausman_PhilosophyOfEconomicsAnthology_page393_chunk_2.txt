discovery of errors? there is, in our view, a fundamental inconsistency in kirzners attempt tointegrate the innovativeness of entrepreneurial activity into an equilib- rium framework by modeling it as discovery of erroneously overlooked opportunities. 22the critical step in kirzners argument, the step that is intended to establish a middle ground between a teleological and a non-teleological understanding of the market process, is his extension of the notion of a divergence between different parts of the market ( 1985 ,p .6 2 ) from a cross-sectional to an intertemporal interpretation. 23according to the cross-sectional interpretation, the entrepreneur acts essentially as arbitrageur: bytaking advantage of hitherto unnoticed divergences between different parts in a present market, he helps to bring about greater consis-tency (kirzner, 1985 ,pp.61ff.). according to the intertemporal interpreta- tion, the entrepreneur takes advantage of yet unnoticed divergences betweentodays market and tomorrows market, thus helping to coordinate markets also across time ( ibid. ,p.62). 24 whatever may be said about the knowability of divergences in the cross- sectional interpretation, it should be obvious that the notion of intertem- poral divergences between markets at different points in time is inherently problematic. if, as we must assume, divergences between todays and tomor-rows markets are typically associated with differences between todays and tomorrows knowledge ,what does it mean to say that entrepreneurial alert- ness corrects the failure to realize divergences between present and future

andlikewise all the circumstances that are common to any important class ofcases. the conclusions correctly deduced from these assumptions, wouldbe as true in the abstract as those of mathematics; and would be as near anapproximation as abstract truth can ever be, to truth in the concrete. when the principles of political economy are to be applied to a particular case, then it is necessary to take into account all the individual circumstancesof that case; not only examining to which of the sets of circumstances con-templated by the abstract science the circumstances of the case in question correspond, but likewise what other circumstances may exist in that case, which not being common to it with any large and strongly-marked class ofcases, have not fallen under the cognizance of the science. these circum-stances have been called disturbing causes. andhere only it is that an element of uncertainty enters into the process an uncertainty inherent in the natureof these complex phenomena, and arising from the impossibility of beingquite sure that all the circumstances of the particular case are known to ussufciently in detail, and that our attention is not unduly diverted from anyof them. this constitutes the only uncertainty of political economy; and not of it alone, but of the moral sciences in general. when the disturbing causesare known, the allowance necessary to be made for them detracts in no wayfrom scientic precision, nor constitutes any deviation from the ap riori method. the disturbing causes are not handed over to be dealt with by

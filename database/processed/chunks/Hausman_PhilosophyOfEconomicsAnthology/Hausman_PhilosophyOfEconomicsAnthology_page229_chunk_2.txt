political conict. but though they may be relatively free fromthe ideologies of the practitioners, they develop not less distorting ideologiesof their own. there is more comfort in the observation that no economicideology lasts forever and that, with a likelihood that approximates certainty,weeventually grow out of each. this follows not only from the fact that social patterns change and that hence every economic ideology is bound to witherbut also from the relation that ideology bears to that prescientic cognitiveact which we have called vision. since this act induces fact nding andanalysis and since these tend to destroy whatever will not stand their tests,no economic ideology could survive indenitely even in a stationary socialworld. as time wears on and these tests are being perfected, they do their workmore quickly and more effectively. butthis still leaves us with the result that some ideology will always be with us and so, i feel convinced, it will. butthis is no misfortune. it is pertinent to remember another aspect of the relation between ideology and vision. that prescientic cognitive act which is the source of our ideologies is also the prerequisite of our scientic work.nonew departure in any science is possible without it. through it we acquire new material for our scientic endeavors and something to formulate, todefend, to attack. our stock of facts and tools grows and rejuvenates itself inthe process. and so though we proceed slowly because of our ideologies,wemight not proceed at all without them.

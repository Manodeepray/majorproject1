( 1992 )choose a particular institutional context in which sellers independently post selling prices at the beginning of each period. buyers,queued at random, choose to make their purchases one at a time. thekahneman, knetsch, thaler argument implies that in the rst period, prices will be highest under marginal cost disclosure, where buyers are informed of the price implications of the sales tax, because the disclosure serves to justifyprice increases and to reduce any resistance to them.

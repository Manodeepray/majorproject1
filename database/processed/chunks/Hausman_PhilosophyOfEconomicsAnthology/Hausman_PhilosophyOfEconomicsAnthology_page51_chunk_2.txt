the desire of wealth. the science then proceeds to investigatethe laws which govern these several operations, under the supposition thatman is a being who is determined, by the necessity of his nature, to prefer agreater portion of wealth to a smaller in all cases, without any other exception than that constituted by the two counter-motives already specied. not thatany political economist was ever so absurd as to suppose that mankindare really thus constituted, but because this is the mode in which sciencemust necessarily proceed. when an effect depends upon a concurrence of causes, those causes must be studied one at a time, and their laws separatelyinvestigated, if we wish, through the causes, to obtain the power of eitherpredicting or controlling the effect; since the law of the effect is compoundedof the laws of all the causes which determine it. the law of the centripetaland that of the tangential force must have been known before the motionsof the earth and planets could be explained, or many of them predicted. thesame is the case with the conduct of man in society. in order to judge howhe will act under the variety of desires and aversions which are concurrentlyoperating upon him, we must know how he would act under the exclusiveinuence of each one in particular. there is, perhaps, no action of a mans lifein which he is neither under the immediate nor under the remote inuenceof any impulse but the mere desire of wealth. with respect to those parts ofhuman conduct of which wealth is not even the principal object, to these

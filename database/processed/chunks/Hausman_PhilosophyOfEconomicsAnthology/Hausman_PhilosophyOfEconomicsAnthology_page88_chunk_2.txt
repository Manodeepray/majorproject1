we are seeking. the propositionsof economic theory, like all scientic theory, are obviously deductions fromaseries of postulates. and the chief of these postulates are all assumptions involving in some way simple and indisputable facts of experience relatingtothe way in which the scarcity of goods which is the subject-matter of our science actually shows itself in the world of reality. the main postulate ofthe theory of value is the fact that individuals can arrange their preferencesin an order, and in fact do so. the main postulate of the theory of pro-duction is the fact that there are more than one factor of production. themain postulate of the theory of dynamics is the fact that we are not certainregarding future scarcities. these are not postulates the existence of whose counterpart in reality admits of extensive dispute once their nature is fully realised. we do not need controlled experiments to establish their validity: they are so much the stuff of our everyday experience that they have only tobe stated to be recognised as obvious. indeed, the danger is that they may bethought to be so obvious that nothing signicant can be derived from theirfurther examination. y et in fact it is on postulates of this sort that the com-plicated theorems of advanced analysis ultimately depend. and it is fromthe existence of the conditions they assume that the general applicability ofthe broader propositions of economic science is derived. 3. now of course it is true, as we have already seen, that the develop- ment of the more complicated applications of these propositions involvesthe use of a great multitude of subsidiary postulates regarding the condition

(forsimplicity, let us assume that we mean the maximum of perfect competitiontheory.) defending the theory consisting of x, y ,and z,friedman asserts that it doesnt matter if xand yare false, provided zis true. professors nagel and samuelson have already exposed the logical fallacy in using the validityofzto su pport xand y,o rt os u p p o r tc o n s e q u e n c e so f xand ythat do not follow from zalone. but there are other equally serious difculties in friedmans position. xand yare taken as premises and zas a conclusion is not just a matter of taste in formulation of the theory. the formulation ts our common, ifimplicit, notions of explanation. we explain the macroscopic by the micro-scopic (plus some composition laws) the market by the actors. we do thispartly because it satises our feeling that individual actors are the simplecomponents of the complex market; hence proper explanatory elements. we do it partly because xand y,plus the composition laws, allow us to derive other propositions at the market level say, about shifting of taxes, or otherpolicy matters which we are not able to test by direct observation.

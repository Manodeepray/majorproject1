inherently misleading. thereis, in our view, no systematically sustainable middle ground between a tele-ological and a nonteleological perspective. and all conceptualizations ofthe market process that suppose, whether explicitly or implicitly, a some-thing toward which the process is moving are, by this very fact, teleological , whether the something is specied as an equilibrium or otherwise. thisapplies to the notion of a mechanical equilibrium as implied in the standardtextbook models of intersecting demand and supply curves, as well as to the thermodynamic equilibrium concept that is implied where the marketprocess is interpreted in terms of exhaustion of potential gains from trade.anditalso applies to images of the market that are intended to capture the constant change in the equilibrium-telos, such as k. bouldings image of the dog chasing a cat (littlechild, 1986 ,p.32). itshould be noted that to question the appropriateness of teleological conceptions of the market is not the same as denying the apparent fact that the human participants in the catallaxy, the game of the market,reasonably adapt tothe circumstances that they confront and to changes that they expect to occur. the predicti vepotential of microeconomic theory lies in the uniformity of such adaptive response among persons. but suchadaptive behavior does not imply that the overall process is moving toward

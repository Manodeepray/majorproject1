counterbalanced by other changeswhich may be occurring independently and simultaneously, that the prog-nostic value of the knowledge of operative tendencies is small. but there arecertain broad changes, usually involving many lines of expenditure or pro- duction at once, where a knowledge of implications is a very rm basis forconjectures of strong probability. this is particularly the case in the sphere of monetary phenomena. there can be no question that a quite elementary knowledge of the quantity theory was of immense prognostic value duringthe war and the disturbances which followed. if the speculators who boughtgerman marks, after the war, in the condent expectation that the markwould automatically resume its old value, had been aware of as much of the theory of money as was known, say, to sir william petty, they wouldhave known that what they were doing was ridiculous. similarly, it becomesmore and more clear, for purely analytical reasons, that, once the signs ofamajor boom in trade have made their appearance, the coming of slump and depression is almost certain; though when it will come and how longit will last are not matters which are predictable, since they depend uponhuman volitions occurring after the indications in question have appeared. so, too, in the sphere of the labour market, it is quite certain that some typesof wage policy must result in unemployment if other things remain equal:and knowledge of how the other things must change in order that thisconsequence may be avoided makes it very often possible to predict with

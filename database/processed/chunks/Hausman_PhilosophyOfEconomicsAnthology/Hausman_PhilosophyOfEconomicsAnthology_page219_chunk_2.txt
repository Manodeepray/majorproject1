mean when speaking of scientic ideology rather than of the ever more perfect perception of objective scientic truths. fewwill deny, however, that in the cases of logic, mathematics, and physics the inuence of ideological bias does not extend beyond that choice of prob-lems and approaches, that is to say, that the sociological interpretation doesnot, at least for the last two or three centuries, challenge the objective truthof the ndings. this objective truth may be, and currently is being, chal-lenged on other grounds but not on the ground that a given proposition istrue only with reference to the social location of the men who formulated it. t o some extent at least, this favorable situation may be accounted for bythe fact that logic, mathematics, physics and so on deal with experience thatis largely invariant to the observers so cial location and practically invari- ant to historical change: for capitalist and proletarian, a falling stone looksalike. the social sciences do not share this advantage. it is possible, or soit seems, to challenge their ndings not only on all the grounds on whichthe propositions of all sciences may b echallenged but also on the additional one that they cannot convey more than a writers class afliations and that,without reference to such class afliations, there is no room for the cate- gories of true or false, hence for the conception of scientic advance at all.henceforth we adopt the term ideology or ideological bias for this real or supposed state of things alone, and our problem is to ascertain the extenttowhich ideological bias is or has been a factor in the development of what conceivably it might be a misnomer to call scientic economics.

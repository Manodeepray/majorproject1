the basis of them alone. t o be important, therefore, a hypothesis mustbe descriptively false in its assumptions; it takes account of, and accountsfor, none of the many other attendant circumstances, since its very successshows them to be irrelevant for the phenomena to be explained. toput this point less paradoxically, the relevant question to ask about the assumptions of a theory is not whether they are descriptively realistic, for they never are, but whether they are sufciently good approximationsfor the purpose in hand. and this question can be answered only by seeingwhether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufciently accu-ratepredictions. the two supposedly independent tests thus reduce to one test. the theory of monopolistic and imper fect competition is one example of the neglect in economic theory of these propositions. the development ofthis analysis was explicitly motivated, and its wide acceptance and approvallargely explained, by the belief that the assumptions of perfect competi-tion or perfect monopoly said to underlie neoclassical economic theoryare a false image of reality. and this belief was itself based almost entirelyon the directly perceived descriptive inaccuracy of the assumptions ratherthan on any recognized contradiction of predictions derived from neoclas-sical economic theory. the lengthy discussion on marginal analysis in the

the hypothesis is designed to explain; andthey must be well enough dened so that observation can show them to bewrong. the two stages of constructing hypotheses and testing their validity are related in two different respects. in the rst place, the particular facts that enter at each stage are partly an accident of the collection of data and theknowledge of the particular investigator. the facts that serve as a test ofthe implications of a hypothesis might equally well have been among theraw material used to construct it, and conversely. in the second place, the process never begins from scratch; the so-called initial stage itself alwaysinvolves comparison of the implications of an earlier set of hypotheses withobservation; the contradiction of these implications is the stimulus to theconstruction of new hypotheses or revision of old ones. so the two method- ologically distinct stages are always proceeding jointly. misunderstanding about this apparently straightforward process centers on the phrase the class of phenomena the hypothesis is designed to explain.the difculty in the social sciences of getting new evidence for this classof phenomena and of judging its conformity with the implications of thehypothesis makes it tempting to suppose that other, more readily available, evidence is equally relevant to the validity of the hypothesis to suppose that hypotheses have not only implications but also assumptions and that

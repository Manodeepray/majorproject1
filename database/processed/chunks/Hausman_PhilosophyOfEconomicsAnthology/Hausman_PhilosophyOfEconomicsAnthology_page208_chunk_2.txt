1988 ), latsis ( 1976b ), and salanti ( 1987 ). 7.the duhemian problem (duhem 1954 )arises because theories are never tested alone, rather they are tested in conjunction with certain auxiliary hypotheses(including those about the data). thus if tis the theory, the prediction of evidence eis given by ta e ,w h e r e ais the set of auxiliary hypotheses. the conjunction taforms a test system and the observation of not eimplies not ( ta) rather than simply not t; the test system is falsied, not necessarily the theory. the duhemian problem is a standard issue in the philosophy oftheory testing but it has only recently been recognized as an issue for economicmethodology (see cross 1982 ,for instance). 8.experimental economics is still too young to tell whether it can substantiallyimprove this situation. for a general discussion of the methodological implica-tions of the literature on experimental economics see roth ( 1986 ), and smith (1982 ,1985 ). 9.popp er (1965 :42, 267, 3878; 1959 :434, 935, 97111; 1983 :1856). 10.this is one source of the innocuous falsication mentioned by blaug ( 1980 : 128, 259) and coddington ( 1975 :54245). the problem of such qualitative (or generic) predictions is discussed in detail in rosenberg ( 1989 ). 11.poppers most important writings on verisimilitude are contained in popper (1965 )and ( 1972 ). useful discussions of the topic are presented in koertge (1979 ), radnitzky ( 1982 ), and watkins ( 1984 ). the question of the relationship between popperian verisimilitude and economic methodology is examined inmore detail in hands ( 1991 ). 12.these concepts are discussed in detail with appropriate references to popperswritings in hands ( 1988 ). other general discussions of these popperian concepts include dilworth ( 1986 ), koertge ( 1979 ), watkins ( 1978 ,1984 ),

reality: just whatdo we have to seal off to make a real city say, norwich become like acheckerboard? notice that, in order to arrive at the checkerboard plan, it is not enough just to suppose that all locations are identical with one another(that is, to use a generic concept of location): we need to use a particular form of generic location. so, i suggest, it is more natural to say that the checkerboard plan is something that schelling has constructed for himself. ifwethink that schellings results are sufciently robust to changes in the checkerboard assumption, that assumption may be justied, even though it is not an isolation. 16 robustness arguments work by giving reasons for believing that a result that has been derived in one specic model would also be derived fromawide class of models, or from some very general model which included the original model as a special case. economic theorists tend to like generalmodels, and much effort is put into generalizing results. by experience,theorists pick up a feel for the kinds of result that can be generalized andthe kinds that cannot be. the main way of making this distinction, i think,is to examine the links between the assumptions of a model and its results,and to try to nd out which assumptions are (as theorists say) doing thework . if a mod el has already been presented in a somewhat general way, it is often useful to strip it down to its simplest form, and then to see whichassumptions are most closely associated with the derivation of the relevantresult. 17

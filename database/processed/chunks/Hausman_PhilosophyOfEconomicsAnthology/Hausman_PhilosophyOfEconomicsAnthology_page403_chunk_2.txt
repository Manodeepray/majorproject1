( ibid. ,p.13), without falling into the seductive trap offered by the opposite extreme ( ibid. ), that is, by the radical subjectivist position. 20.g. p . odriscolls and m. j. rizzos exposition of a modern austrian-subjectivisteconomics is, in a similar way, characterized by a tension between the accep-tance of basic tenets of radical subjectivism and the attempt to maintain anappropriately revised idea of equilibrium ( 1985 ,p.79). 21.kirzner: in the course of this entrepreneurial process, new products may be introduced, new qualities of existing products may be developed, new methodsof production may be ventured, new forms of industrial organization, nancing,marketing, or tackling risk may be developed. all the ceaseless churning andagitation of the market is to be understood as the consequence of the never-ending discovery process of which the market consists ( 1985 ,pp.30ff.). 22.kirzner: i postulate a continuous discovery process an entrepreneurial discov- ery process that in the absence of external changes in underlying conditions,fuels a tendency toward equilibrium ( 1985 ,p.12). 23.kirzner: what market entrepreneurship accomplishes is a tendency for trans- actions in different parts of the market (including the market at different dates)tobecome coordinated ( 1985 ,p.64). 24.kirzners crucial argument, in this context, is worth quoting at some length: when we introduce the passage of time, the dimensions along which mutual ignorance may develop are multiplied. market participants in one part of todaysmarket may not only be imperfectly aware of the transactions available in anotherpart of the market; they also may be imperfectly aware of the transactions thatwill be available in next years market. absence of consistency between parts of todays market is seen as a special case of a more general notion of inconsistency that includes also inconsistency between todays transactions and those to be

dropped from the roof of a building is equivalent to saying that a ball sodropped behaves as if it were falling in a vacuum. t esting this hypothesis by its assumptions presumably means measuring the actual air pressure anddeciding whether it is close enough to zero. at sea level the air pressureis about 15 pounds per square inch. is 15 sufciently close to zero for thedifference to be judged insignicant? apparently it is, since the actual timetaken by a compact ball to fall from the roof of a building to the groundis very close to the time given by the formula. suppose, however, that afeather is dropped instead of a compact ball. the formula then gives wildlyinaccurate results. apparently, 15 pounds per square inch is signicantlydifferent from zero for a feather but not for a ball. or, again, suppose theformula is applied to a ball dropped from an airplane at an altitude of 30,000feet. the air pressure at this altitude is decidedly less than 15 pounds persquare inch. y et, the actual time of fall from 30,000 feet to 20,000 feet, atwhich point the air pressure is still much less than at sea level, will differnoticeably from the time predicted by the formula much more noticeablythan the time taken by a compact ball to fall from the roof of a building tothe ground. according to the formula, the velocity of the ball should be gt and should therefore increase steadily. in fact, a ball dropped at 30,000 feetwill reach its top velocity well before it hits the ground. and similarly with other implications of the formula.

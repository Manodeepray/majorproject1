the real world is equivalent toan immensely complicated model: it is the limiting case of the process ofreplacing the simplifying assumptions of the original model with increas- ingly realistic specications. if (as i argued in section 10)wecan legitimately make inductive inferences from a simple model to slightly more complexvariants, then we must also have some warrant for making inferences to muchmore complex variants, and hence also to the real world. neverthe- less, the enormous difference in complexity between the real world and anymodel we can hope to analyse and hence the apparent lack of similaritybetween the two suggests that we ought to be very cautious about makinginferences from the latter to the former. so what might increase our condence in such inferences? i want to suggest that we can have more condence in them, the greater the extenttowhich we can understand the relevant model as a description of how the world could be . letmeexplain. inductive inferences are most commonly used to take us from one part of the real world to another. for example, suppose we observeracial segregation in the housing markets of baltimore, philadelphia, new york,detroit, t oledo, buffalo and pittsburgh. then we might make the inductive inference that segregation is a characteristic of large industrialcities of the north-eastern usa, and so form the expectation that therewill be segregation in say, cleveland. presumably, the thought behind this

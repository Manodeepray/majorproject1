to be done from studying how science actually is done.although most philosophers who are interested in the sciences study thenatural sciences, economics is of particular philosophical interest. notonly does it possess the methodolog ical peculiarities sketched above, but moral philosophers, whether attracted or repelled by the tools provided byeconomists and game theorists, need to come to terms with welfare eco-nomics (which is discussed in part iiiof this anthology). forthese reasons, it is not surprising that there is so much interest in the methodology of economics. at the same time that triumphant economistsare claiming to have found the one true path for all the social sciences,psychologists, behavioral economists, and neuroeconomists are challengingthe basic generalizations of economics and arguing for a different way ofdoing economics. philosophers of science are at the same time turning theirattention to the peculiarities of particular disciplines, such as economics. therenewed interest in economic methodology over the last generation comes after decades during which the subject was largely ignored by philosophers,while the philosophical efforts of economists in many cases prominentones were sporadic and often polemical.

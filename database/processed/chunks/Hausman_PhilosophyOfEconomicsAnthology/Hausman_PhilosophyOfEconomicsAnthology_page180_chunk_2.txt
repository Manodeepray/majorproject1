to beself-conscious about their methodology. one confusion that has been particularly rife and has done much damage is confusion about the role of assumptions in economic analysis. a mean-ingful scientic hypothesis or theory typically asserts that certain forcesare, and other forces are not, important in understanding a particular classof phenomena. it is frequently convenient to present such a hypothesis bystating that the phenomena it is desired to predict behave in the world ofobservation as ifthey occurred in a hypothetical and highly simplied world containing only the forces that the hypothesis asserts to be important. in general, there is more than one way to formulate such a description morethan one set of assumptions in terms of which the theory can be presented.the choice among such alternative assumptions is made on the grounds ofthe resulting economy, clarity, and precision in presenting the hypothesis;their capacity to bring indirect evidence to bear on the validity of the hypoth-esis by suggesting some of its implications that can be readily checked withobservation or by bringing out its connection with other hypotheses dealingwith related phenomena; and similar considerations.

derogate from their value asameans of interpretation and prediction .onthe contrary, having carefully delimited the nature and the scope of such generalisations, we may proceedwith all the greater condence to claim for them a complete necessity within this eld. economic laws describe inevitable implications. if the data they postulate are given, then the consequences they predict necessarily follow. in this sensethey are on the same footing as other scientic laws, and as little capable ofsuspension . if, in a given situation, the facts are of a certain order, we are warranted in deducing with complete certainty that other facts which itenables us to describe are also present. t o those who have grasped theimplications of the propositions set forth in the last chapter the reasonis not far to seek. if the given situation conforms to a certain pattern,certain other features must also be present, for their presence is deducible from the pattern originally postulated. the analytic method is simply a wayof discovering the necessary consequences of complex collocations of facts consequences whose counterpart in reality is not so immediately discernible as the counterpart of the original postulates. it is an instrument for shakingout all the implications of given suppositions. granted the correspondence

the evidence from inations on thehypothesis that a substantial increase in the quantity of money within a rel- atively short period is accompanied by a substantial increase in prices. herethe evidence is dramatic, and the chain of reasoning required to interpretit is relatively short. y et, despite numerous instances of substantial rises inprices, their essentially one-to-one correspondence with substantial risesin the stock of money, and the wide variation in other circumstances thatmight appear to be relevant, each new experience of ination brings forthvigorous contentions, and not only by the lay public, that the rise in the stock of money is either an incidental effect of a rise in prices producedbyother factors or a purely fortuitous and unnecessary concomitant of the price rise. one effect of the difculty of testing substantive economic hypotheses has been to foster a retreat into purely formal or tautological analysis. 9as already noted, tautologies have an extremely important place in economicsand other sciences as a specialized language or analytical ling system.beyond this, formal logic and mathematics, which are both tautologies,are essential aids in checking the correctness of reasoning, discovering theimplications of hypotheses, and determining whether supposedly differenthypotheses may not really be equivalent or wherein the differences lie.

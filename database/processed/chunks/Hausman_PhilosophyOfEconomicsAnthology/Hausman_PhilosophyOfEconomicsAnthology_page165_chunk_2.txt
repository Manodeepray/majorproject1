ball dropped a moderate distance. such a statement must, however, be sharply distinguished from the very different statement that the theorydoes not work for a feather because its assumptions are false. the relevantrelation runs the other way: the assumptions are false for a feather because the theory does not work. this point needs emphasis, because the entirelyvalid use of assumptions in specifying the circumstances for which theory holds is frequently, and erroneously, interpreted to mean that the assump-tions can be used to determine the circumstances for which a theory holds, and has, in this way, been an important source of the belief that a theorycan be tested by its assumptions. letusturn now to another example, this time a constructed one designed tobe an analogue of many hypotheses in the social sciences. consider the density of leaves around a tree. i suggest the hypothesis that the leaves arepositioned as if each leaf deliberately sought to maximize the amount ofsunlight it receives, given the position of its neighbors, as if it knew thephysical laws determining the amount of sunlight that would be receivedin various positions and could move rapidly or instantaneously from anyone position to any other desired and unoccupied position. 14now some of the more obvious implications of this hypothesis are clearly consistentwith experience: for example, leaves are in general denser on the south than on the north side of trees but, as the hypothesis implies, less so or notat all on the northern slope of a hil lo rw h e n the south side of the trees is shaded in some other way. is the hypothesis rendered unacceptable or

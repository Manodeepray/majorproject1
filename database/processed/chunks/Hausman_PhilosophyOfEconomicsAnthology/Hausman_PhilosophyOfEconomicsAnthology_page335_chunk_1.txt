(17.3) letting the superscripted, lower-case letters designate variables that apply to individual agents and upper-case or unsuperscripted letters, variables thatapply to aggregates, the idea of the representative-agent model is simple. ifequation ( 17.3)gives the demand for the individual for good 1, then the aggregate demand for good 1 is c1 y 1 . (17.4) but, in our simple economy of only two agents, it is easy to check exactly what the aggregate form, of the demand for good 1 should be. it is merelythe sum of the two individual demands, so that c1 c1 1 c1 2 y1 1 1 y2 1 2 (1 1)y1 (1 2)y2 (1 1)(1 2) y 1y1 2y2 (1 1)(1 2), (17.5) since y y1 y2.i ng e n eral, equation ( 17.5)does not have the same form as equation (

abstainedfrom, there being no medium. if, in the majority of cases, it is t to be done,that is made the rule. when a case subsequently occurs in which the thingought not to be done, an entirely new leaf is turned over; the rule is nowdone with, and dismissed: a new train of ideas is introduced, between whichand those involved in the rule is a broad line of demarcation; as broad andtranchant as the difference between ay and no. very possibly, between the last case which comes within the rule and the rst of the exception, there isonly the difference of a shade: but that shade probably makes the whole inter-val between acting in one way and in a totally different one. we may, there-fore, in talking of art, unobjectionably speak of the ruleand the exception ; meaning by the rule, the cases in which there exists a preponderance, howeverslight, of inducements for acting in a particular way; and by the exception,the cases in which the preponderance is on the contrary side. note 1.one of the strongest reasons for drawing the line of separation clearly and broadly between science and art is the following: that the principle of classication inscience most conveniently follows the classication of causes ,while arts must nec- essarily be classied according to the classication of the effects ,the production of which is their appropriate end. now an effect, whether in physics or morals,commonly depends upon a concurrenc eofcauses, and it frequently happens that several of these causes belong to different sciences. thus in the construction

a relationship of mutuality: inferences arefounded partly on unexamined beliefs; but these inferences, in turn, maysuggest the modication of those beliefs. thus, theory presents us withsome a priori (in the sense of not currently questioned) restrictions on empirical investigation; while the empir ical results help generate beliefs (or new theories) which are prior to furthe rinvestigations. haavelmo expresses the essentials of weak apriorism clearly: howcan we actually distinguish between the original system and a derived system ...?that is not a problem of mathematical independence or the like; more generally, it is not a problem of pure logic, but a problem of actually knowing some- thing about the real phenomena, and of making realistic assumptions about them. intrying to establish relations with a high degree of autonomy we take into consid- eration various changes in the economic structure which might upset our relations, wetrytodig down to such relationships as actually might be expected to have a degree of invariance with respect to certain changes in structure that are reasonable . (haavelmo 144: 29) the objection to the new classical strategy of strong apriorism is not that it involves non-empirical principles (beliefs) all empirical research does that. rather, it is that it is committed so strongly to these beliefs that it doesnot permit them to adjust in the interplay of theorizing with the testing of

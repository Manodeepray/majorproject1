law is an idealization of the results of empirical observations and holds withah i g hd e g r e eo fa c c u r a c ya tm o d e r a t et e m p e r a t u r e s and low pressures. the gas law appears to be an approximate truth about physical reality, but nevertheless physicists were not happy with its sui generis quality. thesolution is found in the kinetic theory of gases, which provides an accountof the gas laws as a deduction from newtonian mechanics. the kinetic the-ory is also based on an idealization: the gas is assumed to be composed ofmolecules regarded as perfectly elastic point masses. with the added assump-tion that the velocities of the molecules are distributed according to a par-ticular random distribution that they are equally likely to move in everydirection it is possible to derive the gas laws. t emperature correspondstothe mean energy of the molecules and pressure to the mean momen- tum transferred by contact with the walls of the containing vessel. thekinetic theory of gases thus constitutes a redu ction of the macrophysical gas laws to the microphysical newtonian mechanics.

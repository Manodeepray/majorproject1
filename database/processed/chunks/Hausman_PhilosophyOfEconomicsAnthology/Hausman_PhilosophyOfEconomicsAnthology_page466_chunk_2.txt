feminine dualism, nor forgoing eval-uation. the key to this approach lies in an unlinking of our judgments aboutvalue that is, about what is meritorious or less meritorious in economicpractice from our perceptions of gender. the notion that masculine economics is good economics depends on ageneral cultural association of masculinity with superiority and feminin- ity with inferiority, or, in other words, a mental linking of value (supe-rior inferior) and gender (masculine feminine) dualisms. any reader who might question the asymmetry of this linking, preferring, perhaps, to thinkof gender differences in terms of a more benign complementarity, shouldponder some of the more obvious manifestations of asymmetry in the socialdomain. rough tomboy girls are so cially acceptable and even praised, but woetothe gentle-natured boy who is labeled a sissy; a woman may wear pants, but a man may not wear a skirt. the sexist association of femininitywith lesser worth implicit in such judgments, it should be noted, is not a matter of isolated personal beliefs but rather a matter of cultural and evencognitive habit. research on human cognition suggests that dualisms such as superior inferior and masculine feminine play an essential role in structuring ourunderstanding (lakoff and johnson, 1980 ;n e lson, forthcoming ,c h . 1).

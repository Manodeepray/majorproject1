investment (folbre, 1994a ). programs to improve child nutrition or preschool and primary education, for example, are usu- ally thought of as social programs, merely frosting on the scal cake, ratherthan as economic programs, designed to advance investment in human capi-tal. programs to increase the quality of paid childcare arrangements are oftenthought of as consumption goods for parents, rather than as investmentsin children and in necessary infrastructure for parental (and particularly,givenstereotyped patterns of work distribution within families, mothers) participation in the life of the community. standard economic analysis andpedagogy tend to reinforce such trivialization: recall that the mythical eco-nomic mushroom man springs up without any need for provisioning byothers in his youth, and recall that the actual work by women in historicallyproviding such direct provisioning does not count as economic. consider, as a specic example, the treatment of the subject of human capital in a standard labor economics textbook. it does not begin with a focuson nutrition, socialization, and informal and formal education of childrenwithin families and public schools, but rather with the college choice decision of the young adult (ehrenberg and smith, 1994 ). while there is, of course, some pedagogical benet in designing textbook examples to appeal to theimmediate interests of the students, there seems to be no pedagogical reason

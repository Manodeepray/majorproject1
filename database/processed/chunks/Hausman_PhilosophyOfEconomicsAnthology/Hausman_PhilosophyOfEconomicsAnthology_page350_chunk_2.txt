by the growing currentinterest among game theorists in concepts of bounded rationality and oflearning. although i believe these are conceptually the right directions totake, if the exercises are guided by introspective model development, unin-formed by observations and testing, they are unlikely to achieve their fullpredictive potential. experimentalists have attempted to implement the condition of com- mon knowledge by publicly announcing instructions, payoffs, and otherconditions in an experiment. some examples of this process would be roth (1987 )innash bargaining games, smith, suchanek and williams (smith, 1991 ,19) in nite horizon asset trading experiments, and mccabe ( 1989 )i n nite horizon at money experiments, but there are many others. however,it should be noted that administering common instructions in public liter-ally achieves common information notcommon knowledge in the sense of expectations. in other words, there is no assurance that a public announce- ment will yield common expectations among the players, since each person may still be uncertain about how others will use the information. inlaboratory stock markets, each player receives an initial endowment in cash and shares of stock. it is public information that the expected dividend

whether truth values can beassigned to conditional propositions (see hoover, 1988b: 6, esp. fn 7). 3.generalizing beyond the linear even to very general mappings between variablesis relatively easy; see mesarovic ( 1969 ), katzner ( 1983 ): chapter 6 and hoover (1990 ): 2324. 4.apoint rediscovered by buiter ( 1980 ), who observes that policy non-invariance requires only that agents take some account of policy rules, not that they have ratio nal expectations. 5.forexample, johnston ( 1972 ): sections 12.212.4; the source for most textbook treatments of identiability is koopmans ( 1950 ). 6.avariation on this theme is the pre-test estimator, which penalizes the statistical signicance levels according to the amount of search engaged in; see judge etal. (1980 ): chapter 3 and leamer ( 1978 ): chapter 5. 7.this proposition is amply documented for general equilibrium theory inweintraub ( 1983 ). 8.this is admitted for the market-clearing assumption, see lucas and sargent(1979 ): 31012. 9.e.g., sims ( 1980 ). despite the unsatisfactory nature of their own response, cooley and leroys criticism of the equivocations and invalid deductions drawn from vector autoregressions by sims and others remains correct andimportant.

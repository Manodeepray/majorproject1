rst, inescapable in any thinking about human conduct, is fundamen-tally the problem of the reality of choice, or freedom of the will. it involvesthe essence of the value problem in the sense of individual values, and isat bottom the problem of the relation between individual man and nature.the second basic problem has to do with the relation between the individualman and society. the crucial fact in connection with the rst problem is that, if motive or end in any form is granted any real role in conduct, it cannot be thatof a cause in the sense of causality in natural science. this is the supremelimitation alike of statistical and historical economics. for, if motive or end isused to explain behaviour, it must in turn be brought into the same relationwith events and conditions antecedent to it, and then the motive becomes superuous; the behaviour will be fully accounted for by these antecedents.motive cannot be treated as a natural event. a fundamental contrast between cause and effect in nature and end and means in human behaviour is of theessence of the facts which set the problem of interpreting behaviour. thereseems to be no possibility of making human problems real, without seeingin human activity an element of effort, contingency, and, most crucially,of error, which must for the same reasons be assumed to be absent fromnatural processes.

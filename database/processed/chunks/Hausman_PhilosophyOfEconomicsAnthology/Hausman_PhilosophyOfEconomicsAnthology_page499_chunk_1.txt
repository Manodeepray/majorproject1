(p. 506). the claim models are metaphors must, i think, be understoodas a metaphor in itself. as a metaphor, it is certainly satisfying and apt; but,in relation to our examination of akerlofs and schellings models, just howilluminating is it? clearly, akerlof and schelling are claiming that the real world is like their models in some signicant respects. w hat is at issue is what exactly these claims amount to, and how (if at all) they can be justied. translating intomccloskeys language, what is at issue is how illuminating and how apt akerlofs and schellings metaphors are. but this translation of the question does not take us any nearer to

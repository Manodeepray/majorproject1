ling does not spell out this latter result, but a moments thought about the model is enough to derive it.) thus, wehave established a ceteris paribus result analogous with akerlofs: we have discovered the effects of changes in the value of p,when all other variables are held constant at the particular values specied by the model. toput this more abstractly, let xbe some variable whose value we are trying to explain, and let ( v 1,...,vn)b ea na r r a yo fv a r iables which might have some inuence on x.what akerlof and schelling each succeed in establishing by deductive reasoning is the truth of a proposition of the form:ifthe values of v 2,...,vnare held constant at the specic values v2,...,vn, then the relationship between v1and xis....the values v2,...,vnare those built into the relevant model. taken at face value, this propositiontells us nothing about the relationship between v 1andxin the actual world. ittells us only about that relationship in a counterfactual world. butakerlof and schelling want us to conclude that certain much more general propositions are, if not denitely true, at least credible. when akerloftalks about the lemons principle , he has in mind some broad generalization,perhaps something like the following: for all markets, if all other featuresare held constant, an increase in the degree of asymmetry of informationreduces the volume of trade. similarly, what schelling has in mind is some generalization like the following: for all multi-ethnic cities, if people prefer

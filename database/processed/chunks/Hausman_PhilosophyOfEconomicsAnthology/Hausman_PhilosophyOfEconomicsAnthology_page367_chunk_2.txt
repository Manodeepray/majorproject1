the predictions that follow from as-if rational choice have also estab- lished many empirical anomalies. behavioural economics describes theseregularities and suggests formal models to explain them (camerer, 2007). debates between rational-choice and behavioural models usually revolve around psychological constructs, such as loss-aversion (kahneman andtversky, 1979), the role of learning and limited strategic thinking, a prefer-ence for immediate rewards, and precise pr eferences over social allocations, which have not been observed directly. but technology now allows us to openthe black box of the mind and observe brain activity directly. these directobservations can only enhance the development of theories which are basedon more accurate assumptions andmake better predictions as a result. ananalogy to organisational economics illustrates the potential of neu- roeconomics (sanfey etal.,2006). until the 1970s, the theory of the rm was basically a reduced-form model of how capital and labour are com-bined to create a production function. the idea that a rm just combineslabour and capital is obviously a gross simplication it neglects the details

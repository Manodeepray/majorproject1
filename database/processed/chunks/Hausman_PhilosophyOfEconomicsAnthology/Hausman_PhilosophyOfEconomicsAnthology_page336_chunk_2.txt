never fullled in any practical instance. whyshould one accept the representative-agent model and the facile analogyfrom the micro to the macro? indeed, recently, a number of economists rolfmantel, hugo sonnenschein, and debreu have shown that theoretically there is no such analogy. 16nomatter how well behaved the microeconomic functions may be, the aggregate functions, given distributional variations,are essentially unrestricted and need not take a form that is derivable in anysimple way from the form of the underlying micro functions. this means,for example, that if every underlying production function is cobb-douglas,there is no theoretical reason to conclude that the aggregate production will also be cobb-douglas. conversely, if the aggregate production function foran economy is cobb-douglas (which to a rst approximation it appearstobe for the u.s. economy), there is no reason to believe that this tells us anything at all about the shape of the underlying production functions. there is a strong belief, expressed not only in the ordinary practice of macroeconomics but in the methodological writings of philosophers of eco-nomics, that aggregation does not alter the fundamental categories of eco-nomics. whereas in physics molecules have one sort of description andgases, even though they are aggregations of molecules, quite another, ineconomics real gdp is much like any other real good. uskali m aki makes

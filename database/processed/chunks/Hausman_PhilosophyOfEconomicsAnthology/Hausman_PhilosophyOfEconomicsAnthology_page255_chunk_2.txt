the efciency of relocating polluting industries in ldcs that summers points to depends in large part on the lopsided dis-tribution of wealth. indeed one can interpret r and p as standing for rich and poor and take t 2tobe the current technology (with pollut- ing industries located in rich countries), zthe current level of preference satisfaction for representative members of rich and poor countries, and s the pareto improvement that relocating the polluting industries will makepossible. although sis a pareto improvement over z,itcannot be compared toz,which could be achieved by redistribution without shifting polluting industries. only in the case in which one utility possibility curve is inside ofthe other can one make a pure efciency comparison that does not takeaparticular distribution for granted. what makes sap a r e t oimprovement over zis not a larger pie. sis a pareto improvement over zbecause of where s andzsit on their respective frontiers. the greater efciency of sdepends on the distribution as well as the frontiers. endorsing pareto improvementsis not neutral with respect to distributional questions. inaddition to the failure of the strategy of separating a specically eco- nomic dimension of evaluation concern ed exclusively with efciency, let us briey mention ve other ethical problems with cost-benet analysis. first,its appraisals are based on a comparison of willingness-to-pay rather thanof welfare gains or losses of different people. although willingness-to-payobviously has something to do with welfare and preference, it also dependson expectations concerning what it is appropriate to purchase and for what price. willingness to pay, like the amount of money one would require in

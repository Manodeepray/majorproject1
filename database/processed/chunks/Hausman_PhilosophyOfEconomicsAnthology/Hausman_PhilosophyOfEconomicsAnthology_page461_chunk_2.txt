least as much on matters for which far too littleconcern is shown. specically, i have argued that the problems of the modern discipline relate fundamentally to ontological neglect. in consequence, myownendeavour to help improve things has involved explicit and sustained ontological elaboration focusing on implications for explanatory conductin the social realm. others have contributed in similar fashion. the result is a project that has been not only more explicitly and system- atically oriented to ontological in vestigation in economics than most other projects, being concerned indeed to e laborate a social metaphysics for social science, but also found to sustain a conception of social life that is far richer,that contains signicantly more depth , than most competing conceptionsin economics. the conception defended is likely to be contentious, of course. and, whatever the worth of this project and its results, it is the case that itscontribution will always be practically conditioned, fallible, partial and likely transient. but whatever else might or might not be claimed of the project i have been discussing, i think it clearly isthe case that if we question what is distinctive about it in the context of modern economics, a realist orientation,in the senses indicated throughout, has got more than a little to do with it.

in principle be made. efciency means that those sorts of improve- ments are not to be had, but nothing more. a second reason why peopleought not to be overly impressed with the rst welfare theorem is that perfectcompetition is impossible. a third reason is that, as lipsey and lancaster established ( 1956 ), the efciency of perfect competition does not justify attempts to eliminate particular impediments to actual competition. (t ograsp the intuition, consider a rough example: the distortions present in an economy in which half the output was in monopolized industries might belessened by monopolizing the other half, even though making all industriescompetitive would be still better.) unless one were to achieve perfect com- petition, which is impossible, eliminating market imperfections may well diminish rather than improve efciency. there is no way to know, ap riori. similar considerations undermine the signicance of the second welfare theorem. even if massive initial redistribution were politically feasible, per-fect competition remains impossible, and eliminating market imperfections does not necessarily improve efciency. we do not mean to underestimateeither the actual magnitude of inefciencies in the world or the moral impor-tance of avoiding these inefciencies, but the two welfare theorems are ofno help in identifying or eliminating real inefciencies. who cares whetheraperfectly competitive economy, which is not possible, is pareto efcient

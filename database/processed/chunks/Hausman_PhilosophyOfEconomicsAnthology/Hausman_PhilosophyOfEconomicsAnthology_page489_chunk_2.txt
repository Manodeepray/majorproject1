his model world. the main conclu- sion is simple and startling. he shows that if cars are to be traded at all, theremust be a single market price p. then: however,with any price p, average quality is p 2 and therefore at no price will any trade take place at all: in spite of the fact that at any given price [between certain limits] there are traders of type one who are willing to sell their automobiles at a price which traders of type two are willing to pay. (akerlof 1970 :491) finally, akerlof shows what would happen in the same market if informa- tion were symmetric that is, if neither buyers nor sellers knew the quality of individual cars, but both knew the probability distribution of quality. inthis case, there is a market-clearing equilibrium price, and trade takes place,just as the standard theory of markets would lead us to expect. akerlof endssection ii at this point, so let us take stock. what we have been shown is that in a highly unrealistic model of the used car market, no trade takes place even though each car is worth lesstoits owner than it would be to a potential buyer. we have also been given some reason to think that, in generating this result, the crucial propertyof the model world is that sellers know more than buyers. notice that,taken literally, akerlofs result is too strong to t with the phenomenon heoriginally promised to explain the price difference between new and usedcars. 3presumably, then, akerlof sees his model as describing in extreme form

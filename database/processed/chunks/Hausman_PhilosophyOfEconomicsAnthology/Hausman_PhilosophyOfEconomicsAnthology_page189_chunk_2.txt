micro-scopic (plus some composition laws) the market by the actors. we do thispartly because it satises our feeling that individual actors are the simplecomponents of the complex market; hence proper explanatory elements. we do it partly because xand y,plus the composition laws, allow us to derive other propositions at the market level say, about shifting of taxes, or otherpolicy matters which we are not able to test by direct observation. the logical fallacy in friedmans principle of unreality has exerted so muchfascination both in this session and elsewhere that attention has been distracted from its other errors. most critics have accepted friedmansassumption that proposition zis the empirically tested one, while xand yare not directly observable. this, of course, is nonsense. no one has, in fact, observed whether the actual positions of business rms are theprot-maximizing ones; nor has anyone proposed a method of testing thisproposition by direct observation. i cannot imagine what such a test wouldbe, since the tester would be as incapable as business rms are of discoveringwhat the optimal position actually is. if,under these circumstances, zis a valid theory, it must be because it follows from empirically valid assumptions about actors together withempirically valid composition laws. now we do have a considerable body ofevidence about xand y,and the vast weight of evidence with respect to y, at least, is that it is false. the expressed purpose of friedmans principle of

material means of achieving endsare limited. we have been turned out of paradise. we have neither eternal lifenor unlimited means of gratication. everywhere we turn, if we choose onething we must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we wouldwish not to have relinquished. scarcity of means to satisfy ends of varying importance is an almost ubiquitous condition of human behaviour. 4 here,then, is the unity of subject of economic science, the forms assumed byhuman behaviour in disposing of scarce means. the examples we have discussed already harmonise perfectly with this conception. both the servicesof cooks and the services of opera dancers are limited in relation to demandand can be put to alternative uses. the theory of wages in its entirety iscoveredbyour present denition. so, too, is the political economy of war. the waging of war necessarily involves the withdrawal of scarce goods andservices from other uses, if it is to be satisfactorily achieved. it has thereforean economic aspect. the economist studies the disposal of scarce means. heis interested in the way different degrees of scarcity of different goods give risetodifferent ratios of valuation between them, and he is interested in the way in which changes in conditions of scarcity, whether coming from changesin ends or changes in means from the demand side or the supply side affect these ratios. economics is the science which studies human behaviouras a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternativeuses. 5...

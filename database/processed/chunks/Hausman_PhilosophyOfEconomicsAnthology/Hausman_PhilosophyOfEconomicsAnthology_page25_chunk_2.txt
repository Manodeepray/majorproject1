which scientists will notbe willing to expend unless they are convinced that the general theoreticalframework (paradigm) within which they are working is more or lesscorrect. without such commitments, detailed esoteric research efforts would not be undertaken. although the workaday, perhaps even dogmatic normalscience that results does not aim at discovering novelties, it nevertheless,kuhn argues, uncovers anomalies problems that resist solution within the particular normal scientic tradition. such anomalies can undercut thescientic communitys condence in the accepted paradigm and, given theconstruction of an alternative paradigm, can lead to a scientic revolution. kuhns view of scientic revolutions is especially controversial. he seems toargue that disagreements in scientic revolutions can be so pervasive that no rational choice can be made. 22because scientists in different camps will have distinct views about standards of theory assessment and about how toconceive of the subject matter and practice of the science, consensus can be reached only through nonrational persuasion. according to this irrationalist interpretation of kuhn, the paradigm that triumphs in a scientic revolutionneed not be objectively better than the paradigm it replaced. kuhn disavows such an extreme interpretation of his views, and many historians and most philosophers of science have found such irrationalistconclusions to be unjustied. y et they live on in the work of some sociologists

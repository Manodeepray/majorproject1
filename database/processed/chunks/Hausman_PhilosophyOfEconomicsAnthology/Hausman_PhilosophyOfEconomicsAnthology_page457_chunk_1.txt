(1998, pp. 1978). and h eadds below: there is no issue concerning realism versus anti-realism in economics that is notsimultaneously an issue concerning the everyday understanding of the world. (1998,p.198) nowiconcur with the latter remark. but i draw from it more or less the opposite inference to hausman. certainly, i do not take it to entail, as haus- man mostly does, that we should refrain from questioning the reality

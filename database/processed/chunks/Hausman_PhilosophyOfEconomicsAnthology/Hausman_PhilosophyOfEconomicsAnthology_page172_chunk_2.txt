to a classof phenomena different from the class which the hypothesis is designed toexplain; indeed, as is implied above, this seems to be the chief criterion we use in deciding which statements to term assumptions and which to termimplications. the weight attached to this indirect evidence depends onhow closely related we judge the two classes of phenomena to be. another way in which the assumptions of a hypothesis can facilitate its indirect testing is by bringing out its kinship with other hypotheses andthereby making the evidence on their validity relevant to the validity ofthe hypothesis in question. for example, a hypothesis is formulated for aparticular class of behavior. this hypothesis can, as usual, be stated with-out specifying any assumptions. but suppose it can be shown that it isequivalent to a set of assumptions including the assumption that man seekshis own interest. the hypothesis then gains indirect plausibility from thesuccess for other classes of phenomena of hypotheses that can also be saidtomake this assumption; at least, what is being done here is not completely unprecedented or unsuccessful in all other uses. in effect, the statement ofassumptions so as to bring out a relationship between supercially differenthypotheses is a step in the direction of a more general hypothesis. this kind of indirect evidence from related hypotheses explains in large measure the difference in the condence attached to a particular hypothesisbypeople with different backgrounds. consider, for example, the hypoth- esis that the extent of racial or religious discrimination in employment in

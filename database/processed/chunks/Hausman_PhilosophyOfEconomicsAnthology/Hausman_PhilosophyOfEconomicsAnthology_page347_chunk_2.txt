competitive equilibria. this was the swastika environment in which the demand price is constant up to a maximum quantity, andthe supply price (below demand price) is also constant up to a maximumquantity greater than the maximum demand quantity. if you draw thesedemand and supply curves you see what looks like a swastika emblem.suchmarkets still performed efciently, but convergence to the competitive equilibrium was slow and erratic when the excess supply was very small. vanboening and wilcox ( 1992 )haverecently reported a much more successful stress-test of continuous double auction .they report experiments in which the sellers only costs are xed costs that can be avoided by selling zerounits, and the demand price is constant up to a xed capacity. this lumpyenvironment is structured so that there is no uniform price competitiveequilibrium like that to which continuous double auction usually converges;yetefcient allocations exist. the important result is that continuous double auction cannot handle this environment, and research is under way for newor traditional mechanisms that can handle such cases. the issue is of practicalimportance. airlines, for example, have large ight costs that can only beavoided by not ying. one of the better-known predictive failures of expected utility theory is the preference reversal phenomenon. a subject reports that gamble a is

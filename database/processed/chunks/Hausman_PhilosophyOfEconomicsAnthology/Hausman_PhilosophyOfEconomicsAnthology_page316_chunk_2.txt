theobserved conuent relations. haavelmo, for example, treats autonomy ineconometric relations as a matter of degree. similarly, zellner identies law- likeness with invariance to a broad range of circumstances and boundaryconditions. 10this may be a good standard for law-likeness ,b u t on the present view an actual lawis distinguished in kind from such empirical relations by being an element of the data-generating process itself. the analogy between econometrics and observational sciences such as astronomy suggests that criteria are needed to determine when an econo-metric calculation will be useful. t hat is, rules for focusing the telescope are needed. such rules themselves are derived from theory for the mostpart theory that both is not currently under scrutiny and is supplemental tothe main investigation. thus, a crude rule for focusing a telescope might be that the edges of the object in view should be sharply dened. this followsfrom the theory of optics that light travels in straight lines and from thepresupposition that the object in view is in fact solid. were the more centralastronomical theory to suggest that the object in view was a gaseous cloudwith poorly dened edges, optical theory might in turn suggest maximiz- ing the received light as a focusing criterion. theory, therefore, may modify

can thus reasonably raisemoral objections to regarding economic costs and benets as a guideto w hatought tobe done. costs and prices have a contestable moral signicance built into them. infact, economists do not typically identify the value of a human life with the loss of expected earnings or with the differing amounts different people would pay to prevent a death, and in a serious argument for a worldbank initiative, summers would probably not have done so. but why not?ifeconomic costs and benets are a good guide to what is harmful and benecial, then they should be a good guide to the allocation of risks of deathand injury; and if they are not a good guide to the allocation of risks of deathand injury, why should one believe that they provide an acceptable way tomeasure benets or harms? summers reduces the question of whether ldcsare underpolluted to the question of whether the welfare consequencesof shifting more pollution to the ldcs would be favorable. welfare forsummers, as for most economists, is preference satisfaction. the cost of the consequences of pollution is thus the amount by which peoples preferences are less well satised. and summerss measure of preference satisfaction iswillingness-to-pay. 3

thiscase, the summation still has the dimensions of period- tdollars. this would be more perspicuous if ( 17.6)w e r ew r itten as n summationdisplay j 1pj,t nqj,t n pt nn summationdisplay j 11j,t nqj,t n, (17.7) where the subscripted numeral 1 is a place holder for the dimensional con-version. one might regard perfect aggregation as the idealization of typical aggre- gation in which quantities are affected by changing relative prices. theupshot of the argument here is that the aggregate remains analogous tothe macro gas of the ideal gas laws and is not obviously some natural exten-sion of a single underlying molecule. the ideal gas laws t well only withinalimited range of temperatures and pressures. outside that range, they, vary in a manner than can be accounted for using the kinetic theory ofgases by adding more realistic assumptions about the volume of individualmolecules and the forces acting between them. the equivalent in macroe-conomics is found in the efforts of alan kirman and kathryn dominguez and ray fair, among others, to account for distributional effects in macroe-conomic relationships. 18

(1998, p. 196) the question i want to pursue, of course, is which economic theories are wetalking about? all possible? those formulated in heterodox approaches? economists who have contributed to, or who have been informed by, theproject of critical realism in economics have, in their more substantive con-tributions, generated economic theories that posit a variety of novel entities which in large part, at least, are unobservable. these include particular socialrelations (gender, race, employer employee, student teacher, money ...), other structures of power, social processes, social positions, social rules,evolving totalities, specic institutions, etc. (see, eg., lawson, 1997b ,chap- ter18). this research, like that of others on industrial districts, regions, collective learning and so on, is constantly positing new categories, rela- tions, processes and totalities, etc., many, albeit not all, of which are, orpossess essential aspects that are, inevitably unobservable. indeed, humansociety itself can only be known, and not seen, to exist. hausman is thusquite wrong when he supposes that i would not ...dispute the claim that economic theories rarely posit the existence of new unobservable entities(1998 ,p.202).

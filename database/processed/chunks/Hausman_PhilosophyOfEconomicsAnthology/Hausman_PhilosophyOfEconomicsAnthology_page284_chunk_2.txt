these different notions,which i have tried to discuss more extensively elsewhere, are not, of course,unrelated to each other, but nor are they necessarily identical. 17 the assessment of each of these four types of benet involves an evaluative exercise, but they are not the same evaluative exercise. they can also have verydisparate bearings on matters to which the evaluation and comparison of individual advantages are relevant. for example, in determining whetheraperson is deprived in a way that calls for assistance from others or from the state, a persons well-being may be, arguably, more relevant than hisagency success (e.g. the state may have better grounds for offering supporttoap erson for overcoming hunger or illness than for helping him to build a monument to his hero, even if he himself attaches more importance to themonument than to the removal of his hunger or illness). furthermore, foradult citizens, well-being freedom may be more relevant to state policy, in this context, than well-being achievement (e.g. the state may have reason to offer a person adequate opportunities to overcome hunger, but not to insist that hemust take up that offer and cease to be hungry). interpersonal comparisons can be of many distinct types, with possibly dissimilar evaluative interests.despite the interdependences between the different value-purposes, theycan generate quite distinct exercises with partly divergent concentrationand relevance.

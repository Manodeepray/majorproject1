(again) on popper. the reason is that where economics is most likely to part ways with lakatos is precisely where lakatos borrowed most heav-ily fro mp o p p e r .incertain respects, lakatoss work is much better suited toeconomics than poppers; it seems that looking for the types of things which lakatos suggests one should look for in the history of economicshas helped guide a number of important historical studies. certainly thishistorical research has drawn attention to the metaphysical hard core of cer-tain economic research programmes and it has motivated enquiry into theimportant methodological question of the relationship between empiricaland theoretical work in economics, that is, between econometrics and eco-nomic theory. what the msrp does not provide is an appropriate modelfor the acceptance or rejection of economic theories. lakatoss msrp mayconstitute methodological progress over falsicationism, but it still fails to provide economists with an acceptable criterion for theory choice (or pro-gressive problem shifts). this is part icularly telling for popper since the lakatosian t seems to be poorest where older popperian parts were usedwith the least modication. conclusion inthe nal evaluation it seems that poppe rian economic methodology must be given low marks. falsicationism, poppers fundamental programme forthe growth of scientic knowledge, is particularly ill-suited to economics

and when we observe r in a particular case, we have somereason to expect to nd f too (abductio n). it seems, then, that akerlofs and schellings method is not purely deduc tive: it depends on induction as well as on deduction. but how might these inductions be justied? 9. justifying induction: separability one possible answer is to appeal to a very general hypothesis about causation,which (to my knowledge) was rst invoked by mill ( 1843 ,b o o k3 ,c h .6 , pp. 242247). mill denes phenomena as mechanical if the overall effect ofall causal factors can be represented as an addition of those separate factors,on the analogy of the vector addition of forces in newtonian physics. giventhis hypothesis of the composition of causes, we are entitled to move fromtheceteris paribus propositions which have been shown to be true in a model to more ge neral ceteris paribus propositions which apply to the real world too. 15using the notation introduced in section 6,this immediately closes the gap between a proposition which is true if certain variables v2,...,vn are held constant at certain specic values v2,...,vnand a proposition which i st r u ei f v2,...,vnare held constant at any values: if the proposition is true in the rst case, then (if the hypothesis about the composition of

wide range of phenomena in the real world. the paper, we are promised, is going to tell us something about the institutions of the labourmarket, about business in underdeveloped countries, about insurability, andso on. but what kind of thing is it going to tell us? on this point, akerlofis rather coy. in the case of the labour market, he seems to be promisingtoexplain some features of the real world.

value it at 100 per month, then rms that do not installone risk losing valued employees to a competitor who does. after all, if acompetitor were to pay a worker 60 per month less than he earns from his current employer, it could cover the cost of the safety device with 10 tospare, while providing an overall compensation package that is 40 permonth more attractive than his current employers. tothis argument, critics respond that labor markets are not workably competitive in practice. incomplete information, worker immobility, and other imperfections force workers to a ccept whatever conditions employers offer. but even if a rm were the only employer in a labor market, it wouldstill have a clear incentive to install a 50 safety device that is worth 100 tothe worker. failure to do so would leave cash on the table. other critics suggest that workers often do not know about the safety devices they lack. but this claim is also troubling because rms would havestrong incentives to call these devices to workers attention. after all, boththe rm and its workers come out ahead when a cost-effective safety deviceis adopted.

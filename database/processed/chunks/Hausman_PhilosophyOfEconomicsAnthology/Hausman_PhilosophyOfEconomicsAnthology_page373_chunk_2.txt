is consistent with discounting being a splice of twoprocesses. 3.2. ambiguity-aversion insubjective expected utility theory, the willingness to take bets on events is taken to reveal subjective probabilities of those events. the ellsberg para-dox showed that for a small majority of subjects, when two events areequally likely but poorly understood (or ambiguous), revealed decisionweights seem to combine judgment of likelihood and an additional factor which leads to an aversion to betting under ambiguity. theories of nonaddi-tive probability and set-valued probabilities loosely ascribe this ambiguity-aversion to pessimism or fear of betting in the face of unknown information. ambiguity-aversion has been implicated in home bias in nancial invest- ment (a preference for investing in stocks in ones own country, or rm, orrms nearby), in robust control in macroeconomics, and in other economicdomains (hsu etal.,2005). scottish law provides a useful practical example.

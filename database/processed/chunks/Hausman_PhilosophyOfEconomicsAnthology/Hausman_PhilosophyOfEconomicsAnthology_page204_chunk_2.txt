empirical content and novel facts are the most important in the appraisal of lakatosian economic method-ology. on the other hand, there are many aspects of the msrp which are fun- damentally at odds with popperian falsicationism. the most signicant ofthese is the immunity of the hard core to empirical criticism; immunizingany part of scientic theory would be in conict with poppers falsica-tionist method of bold conjecture and severe test. popper clearly recognizedthat science has experienced periods of kuhnian normal science wherethe critical spirit seems to be temporarily arrested, but for popper theseepisodes are something to lament not praise (popper 1970 ). another point of disagreement is the question of corroboration versus falsication. whilelakatos denes empirical content in a thoroughly popperian way, he hasno respect for the role of falsication in science. for lakatos all theories are born ref uted ( 1970 :1201) and the task of philosophy of science should be to develop a methodology which starts from this fact. for lakatos progress comes from the corroboration not falsicat ion of novel facts. finally, lakatos clearly embraces a historical meta-metho dology whereby the actual history of science is used to appraise various methodological proposals. 15this is verydifferent from popper where methodology is purely a normative affair

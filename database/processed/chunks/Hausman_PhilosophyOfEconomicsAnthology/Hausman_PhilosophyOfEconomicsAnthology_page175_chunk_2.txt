the one factor or the other into account. even the most extremeproponents of realistic assumptions are thus necessarily driven to rejecttheir own criterion and to accept the test by prediction when they classifyalternative assumptions as more or less realistic. 25 the basic confusion between descriptive accuracy and analytical relevance that underlies most criticisms of economic theory on the grounds that itsassumptions are unrealistic as well as the plausibility of the views that leadtothis confusion are both strikingly illustrated by a seemingly innocuous remark in an article on business-cycle theory that economic phenomena are varied and complex, so any comprehensive theory of the business cyclethat can apply closely to reality must be very complicated. 26afundamental hypothesis of science is that appearances are deceptive and that there is a way of looking at or interpreting or organizing the evidence that will revealsupercially disconnected and dive rse phenomena to be manifestations of amore fundamental and relatively simple structure. and the test of this hypothesis, as of any other, is its fruits a test that science has so far met with dramatic success. if a class of economic phenomena appears varied and complex, it is, we must suppose, because we have no adequate theorytoexplain them. known facts cannot be set on one side; a theory to apply closely to reality, on the other. a theory is the way we perceive facts, and wecannot perceive facts without a theory. any assertion that economic phenomena arevaried and complex denies the tentative state of knowledge

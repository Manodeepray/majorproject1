a case of wine. afew years later he is offered 100 per bottle, and refuses, although he has never paid more than 35 for a bottle of wine. in this case giving up the wineyields a loss which is more highly weighted than the gain from purchasing an equivalent bottle. the existence of an endowment effect has been suggestedbynumerous hypothetical survey studies; recently, the experimental focus has been to verify its existence with real goods. ithas been argued by kahneman, knetsch and thaler ( 1990 )that the endowment effect does not apply to goods held for resale; only to goodswhich are consumed. similarly, it does not apply to the exchange of rights(or tokens) on which value has been induced by cash payments in exper-iments. in either case, since what is being acquired is intended from thestart to be resold, losses and opportunity costs are transparently equivalent.kahneman, knetsch and thaler ( 1990 )report both choice and exchange experiments conrming the results with tokens, but establishing the willingness-to-accept willingness-to-pay discrepancy for consumer goods (like emblem mugs, pens, and so on). they also reject empirically the impor-tant qualication that the discrepancy is due to income effects (see theirexperiments 6 and 7). franciosi, kujal, michelitsch and smith ( 1993 )h a v e reported experiments that narrow the reported willingness-to-accept

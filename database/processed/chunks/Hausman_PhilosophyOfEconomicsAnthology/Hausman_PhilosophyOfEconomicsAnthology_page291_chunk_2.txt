in fact, from the considerationthat the use of the capability approach as such does not require takingthat route, and the deliberate incompleteness of the capability approachpermits other routes to be taken which also have some plausibility. it is,in fact, the feasibility as well as the usefulness of a general approach (tobe distinguished from a complete evaluative blueprint) that seems to metoprovide good grounds for separating the general case for the capability approach (including, inter alia ,the aristotelian theory) from the special case for taking on exclusively this particular aristotelian theory. infact, no matter whether we go the full aristotelian way, which will also need a great deal of extension as a theory for practical evaluation, or takesome other particular route, there is little doubt that the kind of general argument that aristotle uses to motivate his approach does have a widerrelevance than the defence of the particular form he gives to the nature of human good. this applies inter alia toaristotles rejection of opulence as a criterion of achievement (rejecting wealth and income as the standards), hisanalysis of eudaimonia in terms of valued activities (rather than relying on readings of mental states, as in some utilitarian procedures), and his assertion of the need to examine the processes through which human activities arechosen (thereby pointing towards the importance of freedom as a part of living).

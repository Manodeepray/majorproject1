feel for why this regularity occurs;but i cannot give any proof that it must occur (or even that it must occur with high probability). my condence that i would nd similar results were i touse different parameter values is an inductive inference. i also feel condent(although not quite as condent as in the previous case) that i would ndsimilar results if i used triangles or hexagons instead of squares. this is aninductive inference too. obviously, however, it cannot be enough to stay in the world of models. if the theorist is to make claims about the real world, there has to be some linkbetween those two worlds. for example, it is not enough to be convincedthat what schelling has shown us to be true of checkerboard cities is alsotrue of other modelcities: we have to be convinced that it is true of real cities. wehave to think something like the following: if what schelling has shown us is true of checkerboard cities, then it will probably tend to be true of citiesin general. what makes that inductive inference credible? 11. justifying induction: credible worlds inductive reasoning works by nding some regularity r in some specic collecti on of observations x1,...,xn,and then inferring that the same reg- ularity will probably be found throughout a general set of phenomena s,

(even though beliefs and preferences are apparently unob-servable, they are obviously not new postulations of economists.) moreimportantly, when economists talk about theories, they usually talk aboutbranches of economics (such as game theory, or the theory of the rm, orthe theory of monopolistic competition) rather than anything analogoustonewtons theory of gravitation or maxwells theory of electromagnetic radiation. theories in the natural sciences appear to be collections of lawlike state- ments that work together to help describe, predict, and explain phenom-ena in some domain. the logical positivists made the notion of workingtogether precise, by arguing that theories form deductive systems. accord- ing to the positivists, theories are primar ily syntactic objects, whose terms and claims are interpreted by means of correspondence rules. 9let me explain. inuenced as they were by the dramatic breakthroughs in formal logic at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, thelogical positivists conceived of deducibility as a formal relationship between sentences, which is independent of the meaning of the sentences. for exam- ple, one can infer the

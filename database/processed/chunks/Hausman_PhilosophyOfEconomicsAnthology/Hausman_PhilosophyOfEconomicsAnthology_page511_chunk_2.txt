inductive inference that similar causal processes applyin real multi-ethnic cities. we now look at such cities. here too we ndstrong spatial segregation between ethnic groups, and here too we nd thatthe boundaries between groups move over time. since the same effects arefound in both real and imaginary cities, it is at least credible to suppose thatthe same causes are responsible. thus, we have been given some reason tothink that segregation in real cities is cause dbypreferences for segregation, and that the extent of segregation is invariant to changes in the strength ofthose preferences. compare akerlof. akerlof has constructed two variants of an imaginary used-car market. in one variant, buyers and sellers have the same imperfectinformation about the quality of cars, and trade takes place quite normally.inthe other variant, sellers know more than buyers, and no trade takes place at all. when we think about how these markets work, it becomes credible tosuppose that many variant imaginary markets can be constructed, and thatthese share the common feature that, ceteris paribus ,the volume of trade falls as information becomes less symmetric. we are invited to make theinductive inference that similar causal processes apply in real markets, withsimilar effects. thus in real markets too, ceteris paribus ,the volume of trade is positively related to the symmetry of information. wegain condence in such inductive inferences, i suggest, by being able tosee the relevant models as instances of some category, some of whose

certainly it would be a veryfragile body of economic generalisations which could be erected on a basisof this sort. y et, in fact, our belief in these propositions is as complete asbelief based upon any number of controlled experiments. butonwhat, then, does it depend? it does not require much knowledge of modern economic analysis to realise that the foundation of the theory of value is the assumption that the different things that the individual wants to do have a different importancetohim, and can be arranged therefore in a certain order. this notion can be expressed in various ways and with varying degrees of precision, fromthe simple want systems of menger and the early austrians to the morerened scales of relative valuations of wicksteed and sch onfeld and the indifference systems of pareto and messrs. hicks and allen. but in the lastanalysis it reduces to this, that we can judge whether different possibleexperiences are of equivalent or greater or less importance to us. from this elementary fact of experience we can derive the idea of the substitutabilityof different goods, of the demand for one good in terms of another, of anequilibrium distribution of goods between different uses, of equilibrium ofexchange and of the formation of prices. as we pass from the description of the behaviour of the single individual to the discussion of markets wenaturally make other subsidiary assumptions there are two individuals ormany, the supply is in the hands of a monopoly or of a multiplicity of sellers,the individuals in one part of the market know or do not know what is going

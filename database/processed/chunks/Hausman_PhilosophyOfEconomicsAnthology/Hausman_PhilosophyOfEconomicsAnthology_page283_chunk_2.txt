example, that reducing the menu from which one can choose will not increase ones freedom. 12butwhenever neither set is entirely included in the other, we have to go beyond such subset reasoning . one alternative is simply to count the number of elements in the set as reecting the value of the range of choice.13butthis number-counting procedure leads to a rather peculiar accounting of freedom. it is odd toconclude that the freedom of a person is no less when she has to choose between three alternatives which she sees respectively as bad , awful , andgruesome than when she has the choice between three alternatives which she assesses as good , excellent , and superb . 14further, it is always possible toadd trivially to the number of options one has (e.g. tearing ones hair, cutting ones ears, slicing ones toes, or jumping through the window), and itwould be amazing to see such additions as compensating for the loss of really valued options. 15the assessment of the elements in a range of choice has to be linked to the evaluation of the freedom to choose among that range.16 5. value-purposes and distinct exercises while the identication of value-objec ts and the specication of an evalua- tive space involve norms, the nature of the norms must depend on precisely

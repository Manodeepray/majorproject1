as a whole that constitute the background from which analytic effort sets out and of which we never succeed in fully mastering more than segments.this is of course true to some extent the bulk of our research work dealswith particulars that give less scope to mere vision and are more strictly con- trolled by objective tests but not w holly so. take, for instance, the theory of saving which does appear in a wider context in the keynesian system butmight also, factually and theoretically ,betreated by itself. from the time of turgot and smith in fact from still earlier times to the time of keynes all the major propositions about its nature and effects have, by slow accretion,been assembled so that, in the light of the richer supply of facts we commandtoday, there should be little room left for difference of opinion. it should be easy to draw up a summarizing (though perhaps not very exciting) analysisthat the large majority of professional economists might accept as a mat-ter of c ourse. but there is, and always has been, eulogistic or vituperative preaching on the subject that, assisted by terminological tricks such as theconfusion between saving and nonspending, has succeeded in producing asham antagonism between the writers on the subject. much emphasized differences in doctrine for which there is no factual or analytical basis alwaysindicate, though in themselves they do not prove, the presence of ideological

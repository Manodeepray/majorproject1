to check exactly what the aggregate form, of the demand for good 1 should be. it is merelythe sum of the two individual demands, so that c1 c1 1 c1 2 y1 1 1 y2 1 2 (1 1)y1 (1 2)y2 (1 1)(1 2) y 1y1 2y2 (1 1)(1 2), (17.5) since y y1 y2.i ng e n eral, equation ( 17.5)does not have the same form as equation ( 17.4). in fact, the only circumstances in which ( 17.4)and ( 17.5) are identical in form is when a1 a2 athat is, when all agents have identical tastes. asarule, the conditions are even more stringent than that. i purposely chose a very tractable utility function .the cobb-douglas utility function is

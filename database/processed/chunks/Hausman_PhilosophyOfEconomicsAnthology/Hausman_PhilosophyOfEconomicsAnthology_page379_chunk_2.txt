of atwo-step process: rst establish parts of neural circuitry that implementabehaviour; then stimulate or disrupt some of those parts and if see if youcancause abehavioural change. 4. oxytocin is a powerful hormone in social bonding (e.g., it surges when mothers breast-feed; and synthetic oxytocin pitocin is administeredin american hospitals to stimulate childbirth). direct measurementfrom blood samples (zak etal.,2005) suggests oxytocin is important in trust. inspired by this evidence, kosfeld etal.(2005) had subjects play a trust game in which one player could choose whether to investmoney or keep it. if she invested, the money doubled in amount andthe responder player (the trustee) could decide how much to repay andhow much to keep. half the subjects were given a synthetic oxytocindose (three puffs in each nostril, then wait an hour) and half were givenaplacebo so the subjects could not tell whether they got the real pitocin or nothing. kosfeld etal.hypothesised that oxytocin would increase trust, and it did. game theory makes predictions about structural variables that might increase trust most reliably, whether the game isrepeated or played once (which does have a strong impact; e.g., chong etal.(forthcoming). but nothing in game theory would have predicted the effect of synthetic oxytocin.

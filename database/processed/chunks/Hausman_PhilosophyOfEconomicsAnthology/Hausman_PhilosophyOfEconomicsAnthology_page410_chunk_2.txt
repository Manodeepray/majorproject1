that valuesare always with us, but he did not make the mistake of treating values asequivalent to facts. in social science, statements about fact are always con-taminated with values. however, this does not mean that facts and valuesare equivalent. economic policies are very important. nevertheless, to convince and carry scientic authority, policies have to claim a theoretical basis. whether fromthe political right or left, a policy in the modern world has to invoke tosome theoretical justication. for reaso ns of both legitimization and logic, policy has to attempt to ground itself upon theory. furthermore, in ordertochange the world it is rst necessary to understand it. we must discern its underlying structures and forces before we can appraise the set of feasiblepossibilities for policy. itis not being suggested that the positive andthe normative can be entirely separated, at least in the social sciences. contrary to the positive economicsproposed in the neoclassical textbooks, it is impossible to separate com-pletely (positive) judgments of fact from (normative) judgments of value.statements of fact and value are typically intermixed. however, facts andvalues are not the same thing.

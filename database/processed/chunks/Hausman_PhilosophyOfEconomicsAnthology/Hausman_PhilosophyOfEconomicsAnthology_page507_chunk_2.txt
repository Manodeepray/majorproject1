is implicit in most applications of economic models , and then says: itsonly justication is success . in other words, this supposition is an inductiveinference from the general experience of economic modelling. butthis argument seems to beg the question. for the sake of the argu- ment, let us grant that economic modelling has often been successful successful, that is, in relation to hausmans criterion of generating correctpredictions about the real world. even so, the explanation of its successmay be that economists are careful not to rely on models unless they havesome independent grounds for believing that the particular phenomena they are trying to explain are mechanical or, more generally, unless they havesome independent grounds for making particular inductive inferences fromthe world of the model to the real world. given the prima facie implausi- bility of the assumption that all economic phenomena are mechanical, itwould be surprising to nd that this assumption was the main foundation for inductive inferences from the oretical models. we should look for other foundations. 10. justifying induction: robustness one way in which inductions might be justied is by showing that the resultsderived from a model are robusttochanges in the specication of that model. gibbard and varian ( 1978 :675) appeal to the robustness criterion when they

the problem is not that we do not know how big a reduction inenergy costs would be required to compensate for a given reduction in airquality. rather, it is that the two categ ories are simply incommensurable. this view has troubling implications. in the eyes of the cost-benet ana- lyst, any action even one whose costs and benets are hard to compare becomes irresistibly attractive if its benets are sufciently large and its costsare sufciently small. indeed, few people would oppose a new technologythat would reduce the cost of power by half if its only negative effect weretodegrade our view of the grand canyon for just one 15-second interval each decade. 2bythe same token, no one would favor adoption of a tech- nology that produced only a negligible reduction in the cost of power atthe expense of a dark cloud that continuously shielded north america fromthe rays of the sun. we live in a continuous world. if the rst technology isclearly acceptable, and the second c learly unacceptable, some intermediate technology is neither better nor worse than the status quo. and we should count any technology that is better than that one as an improvement. scarcity is a simple fact of the human condition. t o have more of one good thing, we must settle for less of another. claiming that different values areincommensurable simply hinders c lear thinking about difcult tradeoffs. notwithstanding their public pronouncements about incommensura- bility, even the ercest critics of cost-benet analysis cannot escape such

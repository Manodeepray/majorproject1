are primar ily syntactic objects, whose terms and claims are interpreted by means of correspondence rules. 9let me explain. inuenced as they were by the dramatic breakthroughs in formal logic at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, thelogical positivists conceived of deducibility as a formal relationship between sentences, which is independent of the meaning of the sentences. for exam- ple, one can infer the sentence rf r o m the sentence sand rwithout knowing anything about what the sentences so r rassert. logicians explored the possibility of constructing formal languages in which the ambi- guities of ordinary languages would be eliminated. in these formal languages,there would be a sharp separation between questions concerning syntax andsemantic questions concerning meaning and truth. the logical positivists hoped to be able to express scientic theories in formal languages. from the axioms of the theory, all theorems would followpurely formally (just as rf o l lows from sand r). for the theory to have meaning and to tell us about the world, it would still need an interpretation.correspondence rules were supposed to provide that interpretation and to permit theories to be tested. originally, correspondence rules were conceivedof as explicit denitions for each of the theoretical terms, but the positivists

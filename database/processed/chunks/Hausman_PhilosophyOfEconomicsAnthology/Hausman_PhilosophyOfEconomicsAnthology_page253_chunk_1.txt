(for example, both aand bcould receive six units of bread.) one also can describe a potential pareto improvement in terms of the possibility of compensation: if xis a potential pareto improvement over y,then it is possible in some sense for the winners in a change from ytox tocompensate the losers. whether the winners could compensate the losers is then operationalized in terms of willingness to pay. if the amount thatwinners would be willing to pay to bring about a policy is larger than the amount that losers would need to be compensated to accept the policy, thenthe policy is a potential pareto improvement

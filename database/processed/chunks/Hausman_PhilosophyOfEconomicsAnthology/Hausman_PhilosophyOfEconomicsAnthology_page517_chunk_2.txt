exploration, not with empirical theorizing(p. 221). in section 4, i considered and rejected the suggestion that akerlofsand schellings models could be interpreted as conceptual explanation. 13.the parallel between models and experiments is explored in detail by guala(1999 ). 14.this interpretation was suggested to me by maarten janssen. 15.cartwright ( 1998 )explores the role of this kind of reasoning in mills scientic method. 16.there is an analogy in experimental method. think of how experimental biolo-gists use fruit ies to test and rene hypotheses about biological evolution. the hypotheses in which the biologists are interested are intended to apply to many species other than fruit ies sometimes, for example, to humans. fruit iesare used because they are easy to keep in the laboratory and breed very quickly.butfruit ies are not simplied versions of humans, arrived at by isolating certain key features. rather, the biologists claim is that certain fundamental evolutionary mechanisms are common to humans and fruit ies. 17.akerlof and schelling are perhaps atypical in that they are satised to presentsimple, imaginative models, leaving it to the technicians of economic theorytoproduce the generalizations. in contrast, most theorists feel compelled to present their models in the most general form they can. if i am right about theimportance of stripping down a model in order to judge how generalizable it is,it is at least arguable that akerlofs and schellings way of presenting models isthe more informative. 18.the grue problem discovered by nelson goodman ( 1954 )isparticularly sig- nicant and intractable. 19.forwhat it is worth, i am inclined to agree with david humes ( 1740 ,b o o k1 , part3, pp. 69179) original diagnosis: that induction is grounded in associations of ideas that the human mind nds natural. if that diagnosis is correct, the

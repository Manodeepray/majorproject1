can with about as much justication be classied under the heading supply as under the heading demand. these concepts can stillbe used and may not be entirely pointless; they are still right but clearly lessuseful than in the rst example because they have no meaningful empiricalcounterpart. viewed as a body of substantive hypotheses, theory is to be judged by its predictive power for the class of phenomena which it is intended to explain.only factual evidence can show whether it is right or wrong or, better,tentatively accepted as valid or rejected. as i shall argue at greater length below, the only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of its predictions with experience. the hypothesis is rejected if its predic-tions are contradicted (frequently or more often than predictions from analternative hypothesis); it is accepted if its predictions are not contradicted;great condence is attached to it if it has survived many opportunities for contradiction. factual evidence can never prove a hypothesis; it can only fail to disprove it, which is what we generally mean when we say, somewhatinexactly, that the hypothesis has been conrmed by experience. toavoid confusion, it should perhaps be noted explicitly that the pre- dictions by which the validity of a hypothesis is tested need not be aboutphenomena that have not yet occurred, that is, need not be forecasts of futureevents; they may be about phenomena that have occurred but observations on which have not yet been made or are not known to the person making

b. m. s. van praag and arie kapteyn estimate an elasticity of roughly 0.6 that is, that a family would need about a 6 percent increase in its realincome to compensate for a 10 percent increase in the incomes of all othersin the community. 22ifwetake this estimate at face value for illustrative purposes, we can employ it to construct a simple multiplier for adjustingwillingness-to-pay values generated by hedonic pricing models. suppose, for example, that a study in which wages were regressed on mortality rates in the workplace found that individual workers are willingtogiveup 2 percent of their incomes each year in exchange for a one in 1,000 reduction in the probability of dying in a workplace accident. this estimate tells us that a worker earning 50,000 per year would be would be willing topay 1,000 per year for the additional safety, even though the expendi- ture would reduce his relative consumption by 2 percent. the kapteynvanpraag estimate suggests that this worker would be willing to pay roughly 600 more for the same increment in safety if he could be assured that hisrelative income would be unaffected by the expenditure as would be the case, for example, if everyone else made similar expenditures on safety. anadjustment based on the van praagkapteyn survey data would thus call an upward revision by 60 percent in the willingness-to-pay valuesinferred from hedonic pricing models. it would be easy to quarrel, of course,with an adjustment procedure based on survey responses like these. other,

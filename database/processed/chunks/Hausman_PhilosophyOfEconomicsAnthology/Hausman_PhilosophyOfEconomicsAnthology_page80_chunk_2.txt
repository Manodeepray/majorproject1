( gedankenbild ). inits conceptual purity, this mental construct ( gedankenbild )cannot be found empirically anywhere in reality. it is a utopia. historical research faces the task of determining in each individual case, the extent to which thisideal construct approximates to or diverges from reality, to what extent forexample, the economic structure of a certain city is to be classied as a city- economy. when carefully applied, those concepts are particularly usefulin research and exposition. in very much the same way one can work theidea of handicraft into a utopia by arranging certain traits, actuallyfound in an unclear, confused state in the industrial enterprises of the mostdiverse epochs and countries, into a consistent ideal-construct by an accen-tuation of their essential tendencies. this ideal-type is then related to theidea ( gedankenausdruck )which one nds expressed there. one can further delineate a society in which all branches of economic and even intellectualactivity are governed by maxims which appear to be applications of the sameprinciple which characterizes the ideal-typical handicraft system. further-more, one can juxtapose alongside the ideal typical handicraft system theantithesis of a correspondingly ideal-typical capitalistic productive system,which has been abstracted out of certain features of modern large scaleindustry. on the basis of this, one can delineate the utopia of a capital-istic culture, i.e., one in which the governing principle is the investmentof private capital. this procedure would accentuate certain individual con-cretely diverse traits of modern material and intellectual culture in its unique

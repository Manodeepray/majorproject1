why there exist validating results with low opportunity cost). but, likemost important instances of duhem-quine, the proposition can be and hasbeen tested in this case many times over the last 30-odd years (smith andwalker, 1993 ,o f f e rar eview). 7the results have made it plain that money does matter; that factors besides money also matter; that many anomalies do notdisappear by escalating payoffs (and foregone prots); and that inadequateattention has been given to modelling the possible relationship between theperformance of a theory and the (monetary and nonmonetary) motivationof decision-makers. 8 butother duhem-quine issues regularly arise. both when the results are favorable and when they are unfavorable to a theory, experimentaleconomists have asked if the observations were affected by increased sub-ject experience. thus, alger ( 1986 )reports oligopoly results in which early convergence to nash behavior does not persist when much longer experi- ments are run. but alger used simulated buyers, and it has been shown thatmean prices are uniformly lower in oligopoly competition when real buyersare used (brown-kruse, 1991 ). these and a host of similar duhem-quine issues are subject to empirical examination and are part of the day-to-dayoperating life of experimentalists.

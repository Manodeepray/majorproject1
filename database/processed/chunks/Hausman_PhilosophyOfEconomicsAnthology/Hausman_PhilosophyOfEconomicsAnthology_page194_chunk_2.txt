with respect to the phenomena it was designed to explain. but one cannot make such an assessment. indeed, thepoint of a theory is to guide us in circumstances where we do not alreadyknow whether the predictions are correct. 4there is thus much that may be learned by examining the components (assumptions) of a theory and itsirrelevant predictions. such consideration of the realism of assumptionsis particularly important when extending the theory to new circumstancesor when revising it in the face of predictive failure. 5again what is relevant is not whether the assumptions are perfectly true, but whether they areadequate approximations and whether their falsehood is likely to matter forparticular purposes. saying this is not conceding friedmans case. wide,not narrow predictive success constitutes the grounds for judging whether atheorys assumptions are adequate approximations. the fact that a computerprogram works in a few instances does not render study of its algorithm andcode superuous or irrelevant. there is a grain of truth in friedmans defense of theories containing unre- alistic assumptions. for some failures of assumptions may be irrelevant. just as a malfunctioning air-conditioner is insignicant to a cars performancein alaska, so is the falsity of the assumption of innite divisibility unimpor-tant in hypotheses concerning markets for basic grains. given friedmans

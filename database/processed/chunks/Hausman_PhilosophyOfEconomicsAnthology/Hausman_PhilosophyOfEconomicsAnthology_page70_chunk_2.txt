future is a system of propositions from which reality can be deduced. as is well known, a leading natural scientist believed that hecould designate the (factually unattainable) ideal goal of such a treatment of cultural reality as a sort of astronomical knowledge. ... wehave designated as cultural sciences those disciplines which analyze the phenomena of life in terms of their cultural signicance. the signicance of a conguration of cultural phenomena and the basis of this signicancecannot however be derived and rendered intelligible by a system of analyticallaws ( gesetz esbegriffen ), however perfect it may be, since the signicance of cultural events presupposes a value-orientation towards these events. the concept of culture is a value-concept. empirical reality becomes culture to us because and insofar as we relate it to value ideas. it includes those segmentsand only those segments of reality which have become signicant to usbecause of this value-relevance. only a small portion of existing concretereality is colored by our value-conditioned interest and it alone is signicant tous. it is signicant because it reveals relationships which are important tous due to their connection with our values. only because and to the extent that this is the case is it worthwhile for us to know it in its individual features. we cannot discover, however, what is meaningful to us by meansof a presuppositionless investigat ion of empirical data. rather perception of its meaningfulness to us is the presupposition of its becoming an object

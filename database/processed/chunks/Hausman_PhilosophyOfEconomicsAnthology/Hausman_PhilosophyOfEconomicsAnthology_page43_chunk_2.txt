rapidly, too. were it not for thegenerous advice of many others, who are expert in particular sub-domains ofeconomic methodology, i would not have been able to do a competent job ofdesigning this edition of the anthology. 42the literature is now just too large! the methodological questions economics raises are varied, difcult, and for the most part unanswered. when i compiled the rst edition of thisanthology, i was optimistic that collabor ation between philosophers and economists would tame, if not answer, these questions. t o some extent thatoptimism has been rewarded: progress has been enormous. just comparethe essays in a current version of economics and philosophy orthe journal of economic methodology with the essays in the early issues of either journal. i would like to think that this anthology, now in its third edition and its third decade, has contributed to that progress. iamperhaps a little less optimistic now (or perhaps just older). the methodological problems economics raises are difcult, and progress isslow when philosophical argument has to contend with social forces andthe reward structure within academic disciplines. there is so much moretobe learned about the nature of economic models, how to compare and assess them, how to relate them to policy recommendations and empiricalstudies, and, most important, how to improve them. may this third editioncontinue to play a role in tackling these questions.

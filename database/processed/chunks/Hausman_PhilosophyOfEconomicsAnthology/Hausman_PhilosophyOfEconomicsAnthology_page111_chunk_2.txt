and values without changingnatural conguration, since reection may yield new insight and effect achange of personal tastes. more fundamentally, it is doubtful whether one conguration is in itself preferable to another. people report and feel two different types of motivation for their acts. there is the wish or preference which is treated by the actor and by out-siders as nal, as a brute fact. on the other hand, people make value judg-ments of various sorts in explanation of their acts; and explanation runsinto justication. in other words, no one can really treat motive objectivelyor describe a motive without implications of good and bad. thus not onlydo men desire more or less distinctly from valuing, but they desire becausethey value and also value without desiring. indeed, the bulk of human valua-tions, in connection with truth, beauty ,and morals, are largely or altogether independent of desire for any concrete thing or result. that individual eco-nomic motivation itself typically involves some valuation and not merelydesire is established by two other considerations: rst, what is chosen inan economic transaction is generally wanted as a means to something else,which involves a judgment that it really is a means to the result in question;and, second, what is ultimately wanted for its own sake can rarely, if ever,nally be described in terms of physical conguration, but must be denedin relation to a universe of meanings and values. thus there is an element ofvaluation in the notion of efciency in the realization of a given end; and,in addition, the real end contains as an element a value concept.

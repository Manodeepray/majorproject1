psychophysio-logical recording). ambitious graduate students interested in this eld arewell advised to pick one tool that can help answer the questions they are interested in, and master it. neuroeconomics is likely to provide three types of evidence about eco- nomic behaviour. examples of each type of evidence are given in the nextthree sections of this paper. 3the three kinds of evidence are: 1. evidence which shows mechanisms that implement rational choice (utility-maximisation and bayesian integration of information), typi-cally in tasks that are highly-sculpted to make decisions that are usefulfor survival across species (vision, food, sex and danger). 2. evidence which supports the kinds of variables and parameters intro- duced in behavioural economics. 3. evidence which suggests the inuence of new variables that are implicit, underweighted, or missing in rational-choice theory. 2. evidence for rational choice principles inmany simple choice domains, evolution has had a long time to sculpt cross-species mechanisms that are crucial for survival and reproduction

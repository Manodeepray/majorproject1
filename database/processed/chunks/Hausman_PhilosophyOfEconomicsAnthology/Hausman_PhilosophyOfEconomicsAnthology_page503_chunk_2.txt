person was content provided that at least a third of his neighbours were the same colour as him, and if...,and if...(going on to list all the pr operties of the model), then cities would be racially segregated. that is not an empir ical claim at all: it is a theorem. perhaps the best way to t akerlofs and schellings models into haus- mans schema is to interpret their troublesome assumptions as the simpli-cations etc. referred to in step 2 of that schema. but this just shunts theproblem on, since we may then ask why it is legitimate to introduce suchsimplications into a deductive argument. the conclusions of a deductiveargument cannot be any stronger than its premises. thus, any hypothe-sis that is generated by a deductive method must have implicit qualifyingclauses corresponding with the assumptions that are used as premises. andthis does not seem to be true of akerlofs and schellings hypotheses. tounderstand what akerlof and schelling are doing, we have to realize that results that they derive deductively within their models are not thesame as the hypotheses that they want us to entertain. consider exactlywhat akerlof and schelling are a ble to show by means of their models. akerlof shows us that under certain specic conditions (there are just twotypes of trader, all cars are identical except for quality, sellers valuations of cars of given quality are two-thirds those of buyers, etc.), no trade takesplace. among these conditions is a particular assumption about asymmetric

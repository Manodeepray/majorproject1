of theory evaluation that recognize the complexities of scientic work with-out denying the rationality of science. many approaches merit discussion,especially the work of the modern bayesians, but this introduction is notlong enough to discuss them. something must, however, be said about imre lakatoss methodology of scientic research programmes, which had a considerable inuence oneconomic methodology in the 1970s and 1980s. lakatos began his workon the philosophy of science as a follower of popper. although critical ofmany details, including poppers view that scientic honesty demands animmediate readiness to surrender ones theory in the fact of an apparentdisconrmation, lakatos insists that poppers basic point remains valid: ifscientists make empty excuses for their theories when they run into apparentdifculties, then they will never learn from experience. what philosophy ofscience should be concerned with, according to lakatos, are not rules forassessing theories, but rules for modifying and comparing theories. rather than asking, is theory twell or poorly supported by the data? scientists want to know whether a new version of tis an improvement over the old. the central question concerning assessment is whether the proponents oftare making as much progress improving it as are the proponents of com- peting theories.

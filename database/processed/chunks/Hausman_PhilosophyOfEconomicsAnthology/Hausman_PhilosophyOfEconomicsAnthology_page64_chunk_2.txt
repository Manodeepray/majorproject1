turned outdifferently from what we should have predicted. if the causes of erroneousconclusions were always patent on the face of the reasonings which lead to them, the human understanding would be a far more trustworthy instru-ment than it is. but the narrowest examination of the process itself willhelp us little towards discovering that we have omitted part of the premiseswhich we ought to have taken into our reasoning. effects are commonlydetermined by a concurrence of causes. if we have overlooked any one cause, wemay reason justly from all the others, and only be the further wrong. our premises will be true, and our reasoning correct, and yet the result of no valuein the particular case. there is, therefore, almost always room for a modestdoubt as to our practical conclusions. against false premises and unsoundreasoning, a good mental discipline may effectually secure us; but against the danger of overlooking something, neither strength of understanding nor intellectual cultivation can be more than avery imperfect protection. a per- son may be warranted in feeling condent, that whatever he has carefullycontemplated with his minds eye he has seen correctly; but no one can be sure that there is not something in existence which he has not seen at all.hecan do no more than satisfy himself that he has seen all that is visible toany other persons who have concerned themselves with the subject. for this purpose he must endeavour to place himself at their point of view, andstrive earnestly to see the object as they see it; nor give up the attempt untilhe has either added the appearance which is oating before them to his ownstock of realities, or made out clearly that it is an optical deception.

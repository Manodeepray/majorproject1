this problem, for theoriesbased on backward induction rationality, is illustrated by the wage searchexperiments of cox and oaxaca ( 1989 ). in their experiments, subjects search adistribution of wages, and must decide in each period whether to accept acertain wage offer; if accepted the subject must forego continued search and the possibility of receiving a better subsequent offer. in this situation,subjects have only to anticipate their own behavior in later periods in ordertopractice backward induction. subjects in these experiments behave as if they are solving the backward induction problem properly. hence, it wouldappear that when common expectations exist (because the subject knows his or her own expectations) then subje cts will backward induct. of course, this does not mean that subjects are conscious of having solved such aproblem, and can tell you about it. inthis journal, brandenberger ( 1992 )has usefully emphasized that the assumption of common knowledge is sometimes unduly strong; examplesare given in which if each of two players are rational and they have mutualknowledge (both know it, but not necessarily that both know that both knowit), then a nash equilibrium follows. these distinctions between variousdegrees of knowledge are certainly helpful, but if game theory is to havepredictive value, it is necessary to go further and seek to discover operationally how to achieve the required conditions of knowledge. theories based uponabstract conditions make no predictions. subjects obtain knowledge of the

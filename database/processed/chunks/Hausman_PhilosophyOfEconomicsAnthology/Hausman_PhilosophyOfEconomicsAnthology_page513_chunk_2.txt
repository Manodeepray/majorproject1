mildly segregationist pre ferences is justied by psychological and sociological evidence, and coheres with common intuition and experi-ence. however, it is not necessary that the assumptions of the model cor-respond with or even with a simplication of any particular real-world situation. thus, we should not object to akerlofs assumption that tradersutility functions are additively separable in money and the quality of cars,or his assumption that cars are worth exactly 50 per cent more to traders ofone type than they are to traders of another. these are restrictive assump- tions, but they seem adequately representative of people who trade cars in the real world. in the same way, the author of a novel might choose to callher principal character frank, make him 48 years old, and x his home townas ipswich. if the logic of the novel requires only that the principal characteris middle-aged, male and english, there is a sense in which this specicationis highly restrictive; but the character has to have some name, some age, and some home town, and this particular specication is adequately representa- tive of middle-aged english men (whereas, say, naming the character duckbill platypus is not). akerlof in particular puts a lot of effort into making his model credible in the sense i have tried to describe. the world of his model is much moreuniform and regular than the real world, but akerlof clearly wants us tothink that there could be a used-car market which was like his model. the

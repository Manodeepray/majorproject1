in the philosophicalliterature of our time. this has been pointed out to me by professor philippfrank. 4.the contrary opinion that is sometimes met with is to be attributed to the simplied versions of the marginal-productivity theory that survive in text-booksand do not take into account all the restrictions to which production functions aresubject in real life, especially if they are production functions of going concerns for which a number of technological data are, for the time being, unalterablyxed just as in elementary mechanics no account is taken of the complicationsthat arise so soon as we drop the simplifying assumption that the masses of bodiesare concentrated in a single point. but a marginal-productivity theory that doestake account of restrictions which, even in pure competition, prevent factorsfrom being paid according to their marginal productivities is still marginal-productivity theory. 5.even there, so i have been reminded by professor e. hamilton, there is perhaps more to praise than there is to blame. 6.see especially s. n. h. linguet, la th eorie des lois civiles (1767), and marxs comments on him in volume 1, pp. 77 et seq .o fthetheorien uber den mehrwert . 7.iamnot aware of any instances in which the rules of inference themselves have been ideologically distorted. all the more frequent are instances in which the rigor of tests is relaxed or tightened according to the ideological appeal of the proposition under discussion. since accep tance or rejection of a given statistical result always involves some risk of being wrong, mere variation in willingness to incur such a risk will sufce, even apart from other reasons, to produce that well-known situation in which two statistical economists draw opposite inferencesfrom the same gures.

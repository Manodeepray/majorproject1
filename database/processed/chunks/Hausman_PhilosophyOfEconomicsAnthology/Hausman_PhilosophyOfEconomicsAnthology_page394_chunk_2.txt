latter can be a matter of speculation, but not of foreknowledge. the supposition that the future is foreknowable clearly seems implied when, in talking about the problem of intertemporal entrepreneurial alert-ness, kirzner speaks of pictures of the future that may or may not corre-spond to the truth as it will be realized ( 1985 ,p.55), of mans efforts to overcome uncertainty by more accurate prescience ( ibid. ,p.58), of past failure to pierce correctly the fog of uncertainty ( ibid. ,p.53), and so forth. itis far from obvious how such insinuation of a preknowable future can be consistent with a genuine appreciation of the creativity of the humanmind. indeed, when arriving at this issue, kirzner simply retreats to the ex cathedra claim that his approach does encompass the two notions, without actually showing how this can be done. he emphasizes that intertemporal entrepreneurial alertness does not consist merely in seeing the unfoldingof the tapestry of the future in the sense of seeing a preordained ow ofevents ( 1985 ,p.56). indeed, he insists that such alertness must embrace the awareness of the ways in which the human agent can ...in fact create the future ( ibid. ). y et, as if the compatibility of the two arguments were obvious, he also insists that the function of market entrepreneurship inthe multiperiod context is nonetheless still that of discovery of errors in the sense explained above ( ibid. ). 26andheleaves undiscussed the issue of what one entrepreneurs creativity means for the truthfulness of anotherentrepreneurs picture of the future. 27

one will not be able todeduce what is to be explained, but one may be able to show that it is highly probable, which is what hempels inductive-statistical model requires. even when limited to nonstatistical explanations, the d-n model faces counterexamples. an argument may satisfy all the conditions of the d-n model without being an explanation. for example, the fact that someonetakes birth control pills regularly does not explain why they do not getpregnant, if the person never has intercourse or is a male. but not gettingpregnant is all the same an implication of the law that those who take birthcontrol pills as directed do not get pregnant. 3one can deduce the height of aagpole from the length of its shadow, the angle of elevation of the sun, and the law that light travels in straight lines, but doing so does not explainthe height of the agpole. a similar deduction does, however, explain thelength of the shadow. 4 what has gone wrong? the intuitive answer is that taking birth control pills has no causal inuence on whether a woman who never has inter-course gets pregnant, and men cannot get pregnant whether or not they

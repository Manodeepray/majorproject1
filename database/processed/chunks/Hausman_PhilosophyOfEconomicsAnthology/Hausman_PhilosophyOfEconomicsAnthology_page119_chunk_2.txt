appropriation of theobject appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker producesthe fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the domination of hisproduct, of capital. all these consequences are contained in this characteristic, that the worker is related to the product of labour as to an alien object. for it is clear that, according to this premise, the more the worker exerts himself in his work,the more powerful the alien, objective world becomes which he brings intobeing over against himself, the poorer he and his inner world become, andthe less they belong to him. it is the same in religion. the more man putsinto god, the less he retains within himself. the worker places his life in theobject; but now it no longer belongs to him, but to the object. the greater hisactivity, therefore, the fewer objects the worker possesses. what the productof his labour is, he is not. therefore, the greater this product, the less is hehimself. the externalisation of the worker in his product means not onlythat his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him ,independently of him and alien to him, and begins to confront him as an autonomous power; that the life which he has bestowed on theobject confronts him as hostile and alien. letusnowtake a closer look at objectication, at the production of the worker, and the estrangement, the loss of the object, of his product, that this entails. the workers can create nothing without nature, without the sensuous external world. it is the material in which his labour realizes itself, in which it is active and from which, and by means of which, it produces.

has played a great role in continen-tal discussions. it has sometimes been asserted that the generalisations ofeconomics are essentially historico-relative in character, that their validityis limited to certain historical conditions, and that outside these they haveno relevance to the analysis of social phenomena. this view is a dangerousmisapprehension. it can be given plausibility only by a distortion of theuse of words so complete as to be utterly misleading. it is quite true thatin order fruitfully to apply the more general propositions of economics,it is important to supplement them with a series of subsidiary postulatesdrawn from the examination of what may often be legitimately designatedhistorico-relative material. it is certain that unless this is done bad mis-takes are likely to be made. but it is not true that the main assumptions arehistorico-relative in the same sense. itis true that they are based upon expe- rience, that they refer to reality. but it is experience of so wide a degree of generality as to place them in quite a different class from the more properlydesignated historico-relative assumpti ons. no one will really question the universal applicability of such assumptions as the existence of scales of rel-ative valuation, or of different factors of production, or of different degrees of uncertainty regarding the future, even though there may be room fordispute as to the best mode of describing their exact logical status. and noone who has really examined the kind of deductions which can be drawnfrom such assumptions can doubt the utility of starting from this plane.itis only failure to realise this, and a too exclusive preoccupation with the

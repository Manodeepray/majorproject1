chapter 26), takes them to be of the same logical type as are predicates such as has two legs, or denitions of suchpredicates. 10according to this view, a model of consumer choice among two commodities does not make assertions about the world. it is instead apredicate such as is a two-commodity consumption system or a denitionof such a predicate. of course, economists do make claims about the world.they do so by using models, by asserting that the predicates that models constitute or dene are true or false of systems of things in the world. drastically oversimplifying this view, it maintains that instead of offering theories like all bodies attract one another with a gravitational force, scientists offer models like something is newtonian system if and only ifall bodies in it attract one another with a gravitational force and ..., and that scientists then use such models to make empirical claims such as theuniverse is a newtonian system. given this parody, one might wonder whyserious philosophers defend the predicate view of models. there are two reasons. first, if one hopes to be able to reconstruct the claims of science formally, the predicate view has signicant technical advan-tages. second, the predicate view offers a useful way to schematize the two kinds of achievements involved in constructing a scientic theory. although

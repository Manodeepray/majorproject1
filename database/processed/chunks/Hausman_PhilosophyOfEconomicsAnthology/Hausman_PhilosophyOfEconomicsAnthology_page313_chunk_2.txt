beliefs. in economics, communitiesmay be dened by their purposes or the circumstances in which they work.itis well known how the changes in the purposes of economic policy in the face of stagation in the early 1970s and the apparent failure of macroecono-metric model to predict the course of economic events broke the consensusin macroeconomics and spawned alternative approaches of which new clas-sicism was the most prominent theoretically. the new classical strategy inthe face of the lucas critique and the events of the 1970s is not to give upthe search for invariance, but to broaden the scope of the search, and tofound it on strong a priori principles. two principles are fundamental: thatagents knowledge is systemic i.e., it is based on, at least, implicit under-standing of the true structure of the economy (rational expectations); andthat agents are continuous and successful (to a serially uncorrelated randomdeviation) optimizers (lucas and sargent 1979 :3049). imposing such prin- ciples results in models for which the consequences of policy changes canbe derived. such models can then be empirically tested. the difculty with this strategy is that it provides neither guidance on how toproceed nor leeway to adjust assumptions, if the data are widely at vari- ance with the models predictions. the new classical organizing principlesare uncontradictable. 8suchprinciples are either not binding, because obser- vationally identical results are just as well generated from other principles,

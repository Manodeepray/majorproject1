andnonscientists, not the difference between scientic theories and other sortsof theories. according to popper, what is special about scientists is that they have acritical attitude. they follow methodological rules directing them to make bold conjectures and then seek out the harshest possible tests of them.these rules require that when the conjectures fail those tests, scientists do notmake excuses. instead they should regard the theories as refuted, and theyshould then propose and scrutinize new conjectures. 20asmany have noted, including thomas kuhn and imre lakatos, it is a good thing that scientists donot follow these rules. 21because theories always face unresolved difculties, these rules demand that they all be rejected. but theories are too importanttothe practice of science to be surrendered until alternatives are available. andalternatives are not easily generated. the questions popper asks may be more important than the answers he argues for. successors such as kuhn and lakatos and a number of sociol-ogists of science have followed popper in attempting to clarify what sortof disciplines the sciences are. y et current investigations of assessment anddemarcation differ not only from the p ositivists efforts, but from poppers as well. as completely opposed as the popperian and positivist approaches

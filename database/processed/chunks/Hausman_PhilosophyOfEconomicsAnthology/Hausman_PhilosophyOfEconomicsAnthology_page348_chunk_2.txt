critique of the feasibility of rational calculation in human choice, simon ( 1955 ,p.104) explicitly did not rule out the possi- bility that the unconscious is a better decision-marker than the conscious. unknown to both of us at the time was the fact that the rst of hundreds of continuous double auction experiments reported in smith ( 1991 ,1 ,c hart 1) would spotlight the crucial importance of not ruling out the rationality of unconscious decision in rule-governed rep eat interaction settings. consider the typical conditions of a continuous double auction experiment. subjectshave private information on their own willingness-to-pay or willingness-to-accept schedules which bound the prices at which each can protably trade.nosubject has information on market supply and demand. after an exper- iment, upon interrogation they deny that they could have maximized theirmonetary earnings or that their trading results could be predicted by a the-ory. y et despite these conditions, the subjects tend to converge quickly overtime to the competitive equilibrium. thus, the most common responsestothe market question were: unorganized, unstable, chaotic, and confused. students were both surprised and amazed at the conclusion of the experi-ment when the entrusted student opened a sealed envelope containing thecorrectly predicted equilibrium price and quantity (gillette and delmas, 1992 ,p .5 ) .

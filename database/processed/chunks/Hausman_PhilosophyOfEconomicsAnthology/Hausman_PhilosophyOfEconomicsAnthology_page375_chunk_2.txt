and is consistent with thebrain acti vation. 3.4. limited strategic thinking ingame theory, players are in equilibrium when they optimise and guess correctly what other players will do that is, when their beliefs about other players strategies match the actual strategies others choose. camerer etal. (2004) describe an alternative cognitive hierarchy (ch) theory in whichplayers use various steps of strategic thinking. some step-0 players ran-domise, other step-1 players anticipate randomisation and best-respond toit, step-2 players best-respond to a mixture of step-0 and step-1 players,and so on. since the highest-step players anticipate correctly the distribu-tion of what other players will do, their beliefs are in equilibrium, but thebeliefs of lower-step thinkers are not in equilibrium because they do notguess correctly what higher-step players will do. this model (and earlierversions introduced by others) ts empirical data from dozens of game experiments with many different structural forms (mixed-equilibria, coor- dination, dominance-solvable games and so forth). tolook for evidence of limited strategic thinking in the brain, bhatt and camerer (2005) did fmri of players when they made choices, and whenthey expressed beliefs about what other players would do. they found that

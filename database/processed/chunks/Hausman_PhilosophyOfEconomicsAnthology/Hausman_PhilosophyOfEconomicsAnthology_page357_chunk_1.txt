( 1988 )nd signicantly lower offers in the dictator game than in the ultimatum game. hoffmanet al. ( 1992 )corroborate these results and report dramatically lower offers (two-thirds offer zero) when the dictator game is run double blind: theexperimenter does not know the decisions or payoffs of any subject. t o put it another way, the dictator results are highly sensitive to the degreeof anonymity from other persons. this suggests that the ultimatum gameresults are due primarily to strategic and expectational considerations, and not just to a taste for fair outcomes. the same considerations apply to theabove market experiments. methodology and experiment

(if the game is altered by interchanging the (50 : 50) and (60 : 30) payoff boxes, thereby removing player 2s ability to punish imme-diately, then cooperation fails to emerge). this is not the game-theoreticroute to repeated-play cooperation because the bargainers are assumed to have common expectations (knowledge). but, as we have seen, commonexpectations is achieved by a process of play, not by deductive analysis. part of this process may be to punish in ways that will be clearly understood. efciency and underrevelation are compatible itis well-known that a market participant, whether a buyer or seller, can sometimes tilt the conditions of the transaction toward personal gain andawayfrom market efciency, by not revealing true willingness to trade. consequently, economists often seem to argue as if market efciency must rely on complete revelation of preferences. asan empirical counterexample, consider the version of the uniform price double auction mechanism studied in mccabe, rassenti and smith

be balancedagainst the costs of achieving it. the example illustrates both the impossibility of testing a theory by its assumptions and also the ambiguity of the concept the assumptions of atheory. the formula s 1 2gt 2is valid for bodies falling in a vacuum and can be derived by analyzing the behavior of such bodies. it can therefore bestated: under a wide range of circumstances, bodies that fall in the actualatmosphere behave as if they were falling in a vacuum. in the language so common in economics this would be rapidly translated into: the formula assumes a vacuum. y et it clearly does no such thing. what it does say isthat in many cases the existence of air pressure, the shape of the body, thename of the person dropping the body, the kind of mechanism used to dropthe body, and a host of other attendant circumstances have no appreciableeffect on the distance the body falls in a specied time. the hypothesis canreadily be rephrased to omit all mention of a vacuum: under a wide range of circumstances, the distance a body falls in a specied time is given by theformula s 1 2gt 2.the history of this formula and its associated physical theory aside, is it meaningful to say that it assumes a vacuum? for all iknow there may be other sets of assumptions that would yield the sameformula. the formula is accepted because it works, not because we live inan approximate vacuum whatever that means. the important problem in connection with the hypothesis is to spec- ify the circumstances under which the formula works or, more precisely,the general magnitude of the error in its predictions under various circum-stances. indeed, as is implicit in the above rephrasing of the hypothesis, such

we re place xwith medium-sized material entities or objects of sense perception , we get standard forms of ontological commonsense realism. in general, realist theories in this category state that the perceivable common-sense world is real; in other words, that objects such as clouds and clocks,horses and houses, mountains and marmalade exist that the objects thatcommon sense takes to exist do exist in the objective way that common sense takes them to exist. the opponents of realism in the theory of perceptioninclude the idealists (to whom it is ideas that constitute the world) andphenomenalists (who try to construe the world out of what they call sensedata). commonsense realism can also be taken to comprise the idea thatthe mental entities in terms of which commonsense psychology or folkpsychology conceptualizes our lives and behaviour exist. accordingly, thereis a fact of the matter regarding what we intend, want, believe, mean, hopeand fear; that is, intentions, wants, beliefs and meanings exist (even in caseswhere what they appear to be about do not exist such as mermaids andrudolph the reindeer). eliminative mat erialists are among the opponents of commonsense realism about the mental. if we re place xwith the (often unobservable) entities as objects of (most or best, current or future) scientic theories such as electrons, pho-tons, quarks, electromagnetic elds, curved spacetime, genes, viruses, brain states and so on, we get the ontological statement of scientic realism. the world as postulated in scientic theories now becomes the (or a) world that is real. the opponents of realism about the ontology of scientic theories

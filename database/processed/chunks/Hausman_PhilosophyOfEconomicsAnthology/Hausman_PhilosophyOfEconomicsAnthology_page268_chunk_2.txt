nations of choices and the corresponding levels of satisfaction are shown infigure 14.1. suppose, for example, that gary chooses the safe job. if sherwin then chooses the unsafe job, he ends up with total satisfaction worth 450 350 in salary plus 100 from having more income than gary. gary, forhis part, ends up with only 300 worth of total satisfaction 300 in salaryplus 100 from safety minus 100 from having lower income than sherwin.alternatively, suppose gary chooses the unsafe job. then sherwin againdoes better to accept the unsafe job, for by so doing he gets 350 worth ofsatisfaction rather than only 300. since the payoff matrix is symmetric, eachplayers dominant strategy is to choose the unsafe job. analysts equippedwith the hedonic pricing model will conclude that these workers must value the extra safety at less than 50 per week.

not apply to economics. but most writers on economic methodology attemptedtoshow that economics satised the more sophisticated (and weaker) crite- riatowhich the logical positivists had already retreated. 41although milton friedmans well-known essay, the methodology of positive economics (1953; see chapter 7in this anthology) does not refer to contemporary phi- losophy of science, it, too, attempts to show that economics satises broadlypositivist standards. fordecades after its publication, friedmans essay dominated work on the methodology of economics. although almost all the many essays thathave been written in response to it have been critical (like the brief com-ments in chapters 8and9of this volume), friedmans essay has nevertheless remained the most inuential work on economic methodology of the twen- tieth century. one should not forget that there are many different methodological ques- tions that one can ask about economics. the different branches and schoolsof economics face special methodolog ical problems of their own, which are discussed in the six essays reprinted in part ivof this anthology. questions concerning the relations between positive and normative and the character of normative economics are the topic of part iii,although selections in other sections bear on this issue, too.

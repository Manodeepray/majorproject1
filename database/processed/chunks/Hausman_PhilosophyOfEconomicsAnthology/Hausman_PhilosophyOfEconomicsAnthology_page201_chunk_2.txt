demonstration was precisely the goal of poppers theory of verisimilitude. actually a satisfactory theory of verisimilitude would serve popperian philosophyin at least two different ways. one way, as already mentioned, wouldbe to provide an epistemic justication for playing the game of sciencebyfalsicationist rules. such a justication is very important for pop- perian philosophy since without a theory of verisimilitude it can beargued that there are philosophically no good reasons (popper 1972 : 22) for choosing theories as popper recommends. the second functionof a theory of verisimilitude is more practical. verisimilitude wouldprovide rules for choosing the best theory in troublesome cases: likethe situation where both available theories have been falsied. a theoryof verisimilitude would help in such cases because it would providearule for determining which of the two theories in question actually has more verisimilitude: which is closer to the truth. a similar argu-ment could be made for cases involving a choice between a falsiedbut bold theory and a corroborated but modest theory; having a waytodetermine which has more verisimilitude would allow us to choose atheory which is more consistent with the aims of science, which is

(italics mine.) 3.loc. cit. ,p.638. 4.this principle, as the reader will observe, simply amounts to saying that there is no interpersonal comparison of satisfactions involved in judging any policydesigned to increase the sum total of wealth just because any such policy could be carried out in a way as to secure unanimous consent. an increase in themoney value of the national income (given prices) is not, however, necessarily asufcient indication of this condition being fullled: for individuals might, as aresult of a certain political action, sustain losses of a non-pecuniary kind e.g.,i f workers derive satisfaction from their particular kind of work, and are obliged to change their employment, something more than their previous level of money income will be necessary to secure their previous level of enjoyment; and thesame applies in cases where individuals feel that the carrying out of the policyinvolves an interference with their individual freedom. only if the increase intotal income is sufcient to compensate for such losses, and still leaves something over to the rest of the community, can it be said to be justied without resort tointerpersonal comparisons.

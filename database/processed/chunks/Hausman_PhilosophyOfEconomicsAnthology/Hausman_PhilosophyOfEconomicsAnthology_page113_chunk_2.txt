becomecentral topics of discussion. infact even at the second level two forms of social reference must be recognized: the individual ends as they are given are chiey social in origin and content; and in societies in which economic thinking has any relevancethere is a large social-ethical acceptance and approval of individual motiva-tion in the abstract. modern society, for instance, has accepted the right andeven the duty of the individual to pursue his own ends within wide limits; in other words, individual liberty itself is a social value and not merely a fact.thus the second level of interpretation tends to break down. if the notion ofeconomic behaviour is effectively separated from mechanical process, if theends are regarded as ends and not merely as physical effects, the discussionis already in large part at the third level. factual ends as desired cannot bemaintained unless they are given a large element of valuation in additiontodesire. the desires for economic goods and services cannot be held to be nal or to have a self-contained, independent reality. the least scrutinyshows that they are very largely rather accidental manifestations of desirefor something of the nature of liberty or power. but such objects of desireare forms of social relationship and not things, and the notion of economicefciency has only a limited applicability to their pursuit and attainment.treatment of such activities, if it is to have any general, serious appeal, must be a discussion of social policy relative to social ends or norms and socialprocedure in realizing them.

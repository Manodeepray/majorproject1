labor market.itdoes require, however, that we not dismiss the possibility that wages may depend on factors beyond marginal products simply because the models weuse are blinded by their own assumptions. economic methods while models of individual rational choice could conceivably be expressed and analyzed in a purely verbal manner, it seems almost a tautology to saythat in the discipline of economics, quality in method is identied primarilywith mathematical rigor. strict adherence to rules of logic and mathematics, formalization in the presentation of assump tions and models, sophistication in the application of econometric techniques these are the factors, in manypeoples minds, that set economics apart from softer elds like sociology orpolitical science. use of formal and mathematical methods (particularly in the form of constrained maximization) is also often presumed to assure theobjectivity of economic results. abstract and highly formalized analysis isoften valued over concrete and detailed empirical work, for the logical purityof its proofs and for its context-free generality. while good writing and verbalanalysis do not go entirely unrewarded, they are usually considered to belargely auxiliary to the real analysis.

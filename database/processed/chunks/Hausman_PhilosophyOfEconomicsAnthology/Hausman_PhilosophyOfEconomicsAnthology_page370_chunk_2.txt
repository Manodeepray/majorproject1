changed when parts of the circuit are broken or disrupted. studies of patients with brain lesions are useful for testing hypotheses from fmri. if a patient with damage to area xcannot perform a task t normally, then area xis part of a normal circuit for doing t.(lesion data are reported below in a study of the ellsberg paradox in ambiguous choice.)transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) can knock out or activate brain areas, and hence is useful for knowing what targeted areas do. the animalmodel is also useful because invasive surgeries and genetic engineering canbe done with animals, as a substitute for exogenous lesions and correlationalstudies in humans. am uch more detailed level of data comes from recording activity of a single neuron at a time, mostly from primates (and, rarely, from humanneurosurgical patients in whom electrodes have been planted to detect loca-tions of epileptic seizures to locate surgical targets).

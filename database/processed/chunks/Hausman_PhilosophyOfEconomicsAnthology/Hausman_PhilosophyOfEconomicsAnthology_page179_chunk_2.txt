gapin cross-elasticities evades the issue, introduces fuzziness and undenabletermsinto the abstract model where they have no place, and serves only to make the theory analytically meaningless close and substantial are inthe same category as a small air pressure. 34inone connection chamberlin implicitly denes an industry as a group of rms having identical cost anddemand curves. 35butthis, too, is logically meaningless so long as differ- entiation of product is, as claimed, essential and not to be put aside. whatdoes it mean to say that the cost and demand curves of a rm producingbulldozers are identical with those of a rm producing hairpins? 36and if it is meaningless for bulldozers and hairpins, it is meaningless also for twobrands of toothpaste so long as it is insisted that the difference betweenthe two brands is fundamentally important. the theory of monopolistic competition offers no tools for the analysis of an industry and so no stopping place between the rm at one extreme andgeneral equilibrium at the other. 37it istherefore incompetent to contribute tothe analysis of a host of important problems: the one extreme is too narrow to be of great interest; the other, too broad to permit meaningfulgeneralizations. 38

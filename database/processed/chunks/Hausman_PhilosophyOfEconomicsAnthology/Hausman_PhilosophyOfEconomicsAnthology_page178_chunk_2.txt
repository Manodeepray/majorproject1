produced. the factscontradict this particular implication: there was reasonably good adherence tomaximum cigarette prices, yet the quantities produced increased sub- stantially. the common force of increased costs presumably operated lessstrongly than the disruptive force of the desire by each rm to keep its shareof the market, to maintain the value and prestige of its brand name, espe-cially when the excess-prots tax shifted a large share of the costs of thiskind of advertising to the government. for this problem the cigarette rmscannot be treated as if they were perfect competitors. wheat farming is frequently taken to exe mplify perfect competition. y et, while for some problems it is appropriate to treat cigarette producers as ifthey comprised a perfectly competitive industry, for some it is not appro-priate to treat wheat producers as if they did. for example, it may not be ifthe problem is the differential in prices paid by local elevator operators forwheat. marshalls apparatus turned out to be most useful for problems in which agroup of rms is affected by common stimuli, and in which the rms can be treated as if they were perfect competitors. this is the source of the misconception that marshall assumed perfect competition in somedescriptive sense. it would be highly desirable to have a more general theorythan marshalls, one that would cover at the same time both those cases inwhich differentiation of product or fewness of numbers makes an essentialdifference and those in which it does not. such a theory would enable us

whether, however the analysis comes out,economics has any genuine laws. consider, for example, the law of demand.itsays, roughly, that when the price of something goes down, people seek to buy more of it, and when the price goes up, people want to buy less. unlikephysical laws such as boyles law, which states that the pressure and volumeof a gas are inversely proportional, the law of demand is asymmetrical: itlinks causes (price changes) to effects (changes in demand). if an increasein demand comes rst, the price will go up rather than down. second, thelawofdemand is (at least when stated this way) not a universal truth. for example, if there is a change in tastes at the same time that the price drops, demand might not increase. so perhaps the concept of a law is not a usefulone for those interested in economic methodology. the issues here are complicated, because of the possibility of subtle refor- mulations of claims such as the law of demand. one might, for example, argue that such laws carry ceteris paribus qualications: other things being equal, price increases lessen demand and price decreases increase demand.inmyownwork, i have defended this idea, which goes back to john stuart mill (the rst selection in this volume). so i do not think that this project is misconceived. according to the deductive-nomological model of explana-tion, economists can use generalizations such as the law of demand to explaineconomic phenomena only if those generalizations are genuinely laws.

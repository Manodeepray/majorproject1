(2006) show that capuchin monkeys respond to price changes, obeying thegarp axiom, when exchanging tokens for different food rewards. another literature shows that bayesian models are accurate approxima- tions of how different kinds of sensory information are integrated (stockerand simoncelli, 2006). these data are in sharp contrast with many cognitivepsychology experiments showing that bayesian principles are violated whenintelligent humans evaluate abstract events (kahneman, 2003). it is dif-cult to reconcile these two literatures directly, because it is difcult to createtasks in which monkeys have to judge the kind of abstract questions peopleare asked like whether basketball players have a hot hand or

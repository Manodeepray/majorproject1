are never fully resolved, we may note that the theories favored by the rival camps reach remarkably similardecisions regarding a broad range of ethical questions. as a practical matter,then, the mere fact that cost-benet analysis is closely identied with con-sequentialist ethical theories would not seem to imply that its prescriptionsare systematically misleading. discounting the future astraditionally implemented, cost-bene tanalysis attempts to put all rel- evant costs and benets on a common temporal footing. a discount rate is chosen, which is then used to compute all relevant future costs and ben-ets in present-value terms. most commonly, the discount rate used forpresent-value calculations is an interest rate taken from nancial markets. though some critics complain about this practice, use of a market inter- est rate to discount future monetary costs and benets commands broadapproval. after all, if the annual interest rate on nancial deposits is 7 per-cent, one can cover a 1,000 cost 10 years hence by depositing only 500 today.

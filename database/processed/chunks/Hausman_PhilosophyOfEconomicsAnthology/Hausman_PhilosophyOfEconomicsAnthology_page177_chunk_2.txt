or monopolistic according as theelasticity of the demand curve is or is not innite. no observed demand curvewill ever be precisely horizontal, so the estimated elasticity will always be nite. the relevant question always is whether the elasticity is sufcientlylarge to be regarded as innite, but this is a question that cannot be answered,once for all, simply in terms of the numerical value of the elasticity itself,any more than we can say, once for all, whether an air pressure of 15 poundsper square inch is sufciently close to zero to use the formula s 1 2gt 2. similarly, we cannot compute cross-elasticities of demand and then classify rms into industries according as there is a substantial gap in the cross-elasticities of demand. as marshall says, the question where the lines ofdivision between different commodities [i.e., industries] should be drawnmust be settled by convenience of the particular discussion. 31everything depends on the problem; there is no inconsistency in regarding the samerm as if it were a perfect competitor for one problem, and a monopolistfor another, just as there is none in regarding the same chalk mark as aeuclidean line for one problem, a euclidean surface for a second, and a euclidean solid for a third. the size of the elasticity and cross-elasticity of demand, the number of rms producing physically similar products, etc.,are all relevant because they are or may be among the variables used todene the correspondence between the ideal and real entities in a particularproblem and to specify the circumstances under which the theory holdssufciently well; but they do not provide, once for all, a classication ofrms as competitive or monopolistic.

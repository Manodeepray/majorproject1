in hand. suggested readings asobserved in this lecture, the history of microfoundations is a long one. the modern obsession with microfoundations as the sine qua non of macroeco-nomics can be dated to robert e. lucas, jr.s econometric policy evaluation:acritique (originally published in karl brunner and allan h. meltzer [eds.], the phillips curve and labor markets ,vol. 1 of carnegie-rochester conference series on public policy, amsterdam: north-holland, 1976, and reprinted in lucass own studies in business cycle theory ,o xford: blackwell, 1981). an excellent methodological study of the necessity of microfounda-tions is found in maarten janssens microfoundations: a critical inquiry (london: routledge, 1993). moreparticularly, the modern ploy of providing microfoundations through the representative-agent model is brilliantly attacked in alankirmans whom or what does the representative individual represent? journal of economic perspectives 6(2) (1992), 11736, and, with a rich his- torical perspective, in james hartleys the representative agent in macroe- conomics (london: routledge, 1997).

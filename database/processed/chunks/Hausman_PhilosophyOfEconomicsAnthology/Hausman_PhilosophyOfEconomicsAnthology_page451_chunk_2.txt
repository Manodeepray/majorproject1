the competing programs are not realist or fail to berealist enough . the feature of it i want to focus upon here is hausmans reference to competing programs . it seems from the longer passage in which this inference is embedded (noted at the outset above), that hausman hasin mind here only programmes of methodologists, where methodologistsare explicitly contrasted, by hausman, to economists. i should immedi-ately emphasize, then, that hausman is in error if he is presuming, ashe seems to be, that, in adopting such a realist orientation, the compet-ing programs i am addressing are only, or even primarily, those of otherswho explicitly distinguish themselves as methodologists. i do address these.butthey are by no means my main intended audiences, opponents or comp etitors . economics and reality ,for example, is explicitly aimed at an audience of general economists, both mainstream and non-mainstream. i view it as acontribution to economics as social theory. the identied opponents are contributors, or potential contributors, to the contemporary mainstream programme (p. xvii). i optimistically saw (and continue to see) myself asattempting to contribute to a fruitful transformation of the discipline. and

not seen as the measureof all values. 10.on this, see sen ( 1970 ,1982 a,1987 a). in many contexts, the mathematical rep- resentations should take the form of partial orderings or fuzzy relations. this is not, of course, a special problem with the capability approach, butapplies generally to conceptual frameworks in social, economic, and politicaltheory. 11.the belief in this possibility seems to play a part in robert sugdens ( 1986 ) criticism of what he sees as my approach to capability evaluation, namely, ageneral strategy of trying to derive the value of a setof functioning vectors from prior ranking of the vectors themselves (p. 821). he argues in favour of judgingthe value of being free to choose from a range of possible lives before taking aview on what constitutes a valuable life . this criticism is, in fact, based on amisunderstanding of the approach proposed, since it has been a part of my claim (on which more presently) that the judgement of the quality of life and the assessment of freedom have to be done simultaneously in an integrated way, and, in particular, that the quality of life a person enjoys is not merely a matterof what he or she achieved, but also of what options the person has had theopportunity to choose from (sen, 1985 b:6970). but the point at issue in the present context is the possibility of judging a range of choice independently of the value characteristics of the elements in that range. it is this possibility that i am disputing. 12.even this can be questioned when an expanded menu causes confusion, or the necessity to choose between a larger set of alternatives is a nuisance. butsuch problems can be dealt with through appropriate characterization of all the choices one has or does not have. this must

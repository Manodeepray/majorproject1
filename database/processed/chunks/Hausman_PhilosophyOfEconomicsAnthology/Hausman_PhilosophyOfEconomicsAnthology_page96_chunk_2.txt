the changing facts which make predictionin any given situation possible. as we have seen, it is most improbable thatit can ever discover the law of their change, for the data are not subject tohomogeneous causal inuences. but it can put us in possession of infor-mation which is relevant at the particular moment concerned. it can giveus some idea of the relative magnitude of the different forces operative. itcan afford a basis for enlightened conjectures with regard to potential direc-tions of change. and this unquestionably is one of the main uses of appliedstudies not to unearth empirical laws in an area where such laws are notto be expe cted, but to provide from moment to moment some knowledge of the varying data on which, in the given situation, prediction can be based. itcannot supersede formal analysis. but it can suggest in different situationswhat formal analysis is appropriate, and it can provide at that moment some content for the formal categories. of course, if other things do not remain unchanged, the consequences predicted do not necessarily follow. t his elementary platitude, necessarily implicit in anyscientic prediction, needs esp ecially to be kept in the fore- ground of attention when discussing this kind of prognosis. the statesman who said ceteris p aribus be damned! has a large and enthusiastic following among the critics of economics! nobody in his senses would hold that thelaws of mechanics were invalidated if an experiment designed to illustrate

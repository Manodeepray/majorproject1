now the law of diminishing returns is simply oneway of putting the obvious fact that different factors of production areimperfect substitutes for one another. if you increase the amount of labourwithout increasing the amount of land the product will increase, but it will not increase proportionately. t o secure a doubling of the product, if you donot double both land and labour, you have to more than double either oneof the factors. this is obvious. if it were not so, then all the corn in the worldcould be produced from one acre of land. it follows, too, from considerations more intimately connected with our fundamental conceptions. a class ofscarce factors is to be dened as consisting of those factors which are perfectsubstitutes. that is to say, difference sinfactors is to be dened essentially as imperfect substitutability. the law of diminishing returns, therefore,follows from the assumption that there is more than one class of scarcefactors of production. 12the supplementary principle that, within limits, returns may increase, follows equally directly from the assumption that factors are relatively indivisible. on the basis of these principles and withthe aid of subsidiary assumptions of the kind already mentioned (the natureof markets and the legal framework of production, etc.), it is possible to buildup a theory of equilibrium of production. 13 letusturn to more dynamic considerations. the theory of prots, to use the word in the rather restricted sense in which it has come to be used

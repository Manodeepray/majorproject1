western democracies we assume for certain purposes that menin similar circumstances are capable of equal satisfactions. just as for pur-poses of justice we assume equality of responsibility in similar situations asbetween legal subjects, so for purposes of public nance we agree to assumeequality of capacity for experiencing satisfaction from equal incomes in sim-ilar circumstances as between economic subjects. but, although it may beconvenient to assume this, there is no way of proving that the assumption rests on ascertainable fact. and, indeed, if the representative of some other civilisation were to assure us that we were wrong, that members of his caste(or his race) were capable of experiencing ten times as much satisfactionfrom given incomes as members of an inferior caste (or an inferior race),wecould not refute him. we might poke fun at him. we might are up with indignation, and say that his valuation was hateful, that it led to civil strife, unhappiness, unjust privilege, and so on and so forth. but we couldnot show that he was wrong in any objective sense, any more than we couldshow that we were right. and since in our hearts we do not regard differentmens satisfactions from similar means as equally valuable, it would really berather silly if we continued to pretend that the justication for our scheme of things was in any way scientic. itcan be justied on grounds of general con- venience. or it can be justied by app eal to ultimate standards of obligation. butitcannot be justied by appeal to any kind of positive science. hence the extension of the law of diminishing marginal utility, pos- tulated in the propositions we are examining, is illegitimate. and the

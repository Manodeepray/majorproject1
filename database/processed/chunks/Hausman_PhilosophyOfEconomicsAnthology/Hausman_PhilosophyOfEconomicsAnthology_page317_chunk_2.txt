variance). if errors do not possess theseproperties, then it should be possible to formulate a different model thatis better in the sense of having a lower variance and encompassing the rstmodel. (in this case encompassing means providing a basis for calculating what the coefcients and variance of the other model would be without infact estimating it.) in addition, on weak assumptions, statistical theory leads us to expect errors to be approximately normally distributed. just as in astronomy, theory may also guide econometric observations. atthe crudest level, theory suggests potential variables. it also requires that models not imply values out of the range of possible observations.aconsumption function, for instance, must not generate predictions of negative consumption. on a higher plane, we may impose restrictions fromeconomic theory on econometric estimates and test these restrictions againstmore general models. if they are accepted, then theory aids in understandingthe signicance of the observation; if not, the observation may suggest whatelement of the theory is unsatisfactory. another requirement is stability of coefcient estimates. like consistency with theory, this criterion is on a different plane from the need for random errors. the very concept of randomness unexplainability justies it asanecessary condition of verisimilitude. there is no necessary connection between stability and the true data-generating process. economic reality

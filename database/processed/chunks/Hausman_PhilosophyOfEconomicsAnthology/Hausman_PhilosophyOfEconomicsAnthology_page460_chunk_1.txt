( 1998 , p.205). but as i have already indicated there is no assimilating going on; these just are the same sort of questions. both reect the postulating ofthe existence of some disputed kind of entity; and both sets of postulationsrequire investigating. hausmans purp ose in all this seems to be a misguided attempt to reduce all aspects of all s tructures and mechanisms to the level of everyday commonsense understanding as if thereby all aspects can some- how be treated as free of realist or anti-realist controversy. hausman also includes a brief discussion of rms and the supposed law of diminishing returns intended to demonstrate that lawsons emphasison realism distracts attention from the real issues ( 1998 ,p.205). but in this hausman appears to suppose that my critique of economics, if appliedtodiscussions of the rm and returns to inputs , would amount to little more than a suggestion that more variables or factors should be included inthe analysis ( ...the law of diminishing returns ...captures only one factor that generates the complicated phenomena observed. one does not havetobe a critical realist

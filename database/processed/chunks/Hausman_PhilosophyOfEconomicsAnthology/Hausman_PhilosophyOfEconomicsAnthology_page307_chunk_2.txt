aset of unnecessary but sufcient conditions for the effect. this is often called the inus condition. simply put it says that acause is a critical part of one of the possibly numerous alternative combinations of circumstancesthat imply an effect. the details of mackies analysis are not important inthe current discussion. what is important is to notice that causal relationsare captured in this analysis by (contrary-to-fact) conditional propositions;that is, by statements of the form, if it were true that the economy was at fullemployment and the money supply increased by 10 percent, then it wouldbe true that prices would rise by 10 percent . such a proposition sustains ourbelief that increases in the money supply cause increases in the price level.yetits correctness is not challenged by our failure to observe the antecedents to be fullled. 2 the conditional analysis of causality is related to both invariance and control. consider a putatively correct conditional proposition whoseantecedents are not fullled. if it happens that when the antecedents are infact fullled, the conditional proposition is no longer correct, it was wrongtoassert it in the rst place. any conditional proposition asserts the exis- tence of a disposition. the properties of such a disposition cannot depend on whether or not it is in fact actualized. thus, a diamond is hard enoughtoscratch glass asserts a disposition. it is correct whether or not a diamond is ever used to scratch glass. but it would not be correct if hardness were

(17.6) under the assumed conditions pis unique. some conclude, therefore, that in this limited case, one can treat the summation on the right-hand side ofequation ( 17.6)asanatural aggregate quantity analogous to an individual quantity. the conditions for constant relative prices are almost certainlynever fullled; but, even if they were, the summation is not analogous to anindividual quantity. the general price level pin (17.6)still has the dimension period- ndollars period- t(i.e., base period) dollars. t o sum heterogeneous goods, they must still be converted to a common denominator, and in thiscase, the summation still has the dimensions of period- tdollars. this would be more perspicuous if ( 17.6)w e r ew r itten as n summationdisplay j 1pj,t nqj,t n pt nn summationdisplay j 11j,t nqj,t n, (17.7) where the subscripted numeral 1 is a place holder for the dimensional con-version. one might regard perfect aggregation as the idealization of typical aggre- gation in which quantities are affected by changing

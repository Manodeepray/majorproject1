context in which sellers independently post selling prices at the beginning of each period. buyers,queued at random, choose to make their purchases one at a time. thekahneman, knetsch, thaler argument implies that in the rst period, prices will be highest under marginal cost disclosure, where buyers are informed of the price implications of the sales tax, because the disclosure serves to justifyprice increases and to reduce any resistance to them. revealing prots, onthe other hand, will lead to the lowest prices in the rst period, because thechange from the reference (baseline) transactions is greatest, and will lead tosubstantial resistance. the no-information group should, according to the hypothesis, fall between these extremes. the results strongly and signicantly support the kahneman, knetsch and thaler hypothesis. in period one, the price in the marginal cost disclosuregroup was very near the new competitive equilibrium, with prices much the lowest in the prot disclosure group. but in successive trading periods,the mean prices in the prot disclosure and no disclosure groups increase,and by period 10 none of the three means are statistically different fromeach other or the competitive price. these results offer strong conrmationof standard theory, as the sellers in the prot disclosure treatment raiseprices over time in response to the excess demand. furthermore, as sellersraise prices they are not deterred by any signicant incidence of demand withholding by buyers.

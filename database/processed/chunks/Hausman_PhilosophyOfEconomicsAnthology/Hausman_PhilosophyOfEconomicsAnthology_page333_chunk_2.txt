a vast literature on the theory of aggregation. thegeneral conclusion of this literature is that aggregation in which the macrolooks like the micro can occur only under circumstances so stringent thatthey could never be fullled in the real world except by the merest chance.iwant to argue something even stronger than that; namely, that even what appears to be perfect aggregatio nunder ideal circumstances fails. but, rst, let us consider the lessons of aggregation theory as they stand. economics is about heterogeneous things. in microeconomics we choose how to allocate our consumption among different goods or how to allocatefactors of production used to make those goods. in both cases, we con-sider physical things of disparate natures and somehow have to make themequivalent. the role of utility functions or prot functions is to give us acommon denominator, a basis for choosing among goods that otherwise are little alike. similarly, when we calculate nominal gdp, we cannot add up thedisparate goods until we have given them a common denominator typi-cally, money. real gdp is even one step further removed, as we correct the

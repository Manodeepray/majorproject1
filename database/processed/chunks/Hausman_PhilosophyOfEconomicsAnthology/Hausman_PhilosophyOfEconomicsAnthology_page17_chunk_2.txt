apparently do the explaining areplatitudes such as people do what they most prefer. some philosophershave argued that generalizations like these are not empirical generaliza-tions at all. they are instead implicit in the very concepts of action andpreference. 6according to these philosophers, explanations of human behav- ior differ decisively from explanations in the natural sciences. in explainingwhy someone did what he or she did, one does not subsume their actionunder some general regularity. instead, one gives the agents reasons . itis true that in explaining an action one gives the agents reasons for performing it. but do explanations in terms of reasons differ fundamentallyfrom explanations in the natural sciences? can they be seen as (roughly)deductive-nomological or as causal? can they be assessed in the same waythat explanations in the natural science are assessed? philosophers disagreeon these questions. most writers on economics have attempted to assimi-late explanations in economics to explanations in the natural sciences. whycannot explanations in terms of reasons also be scientic explanations in termsofcauses? 7butthere is a considerable minority, which includes dis- tinguished economists such as frank knight (chapter 4), who have argued that explanations of actions in terms of the reasons for the actions differ insome fundamental way from ordinary scientic explanations.

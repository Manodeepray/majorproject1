dichotomy. either they can accept a view of science as exclusively the search for excep- tionless regularities among observable events ...,orthey can accept critical realism (hausman, 1998 ,p.204). now what is false about this dichotomy? afterall critical realism argues that the world is open and structured in com- plex ways. it is because it is so that event regularities whether strict or partial(i.e., demi-regularities) canbe brought about under certain conditions. critical realism thus entertains a priori the possibility of event regularities of varying degrees of strictness; it all d epends. mainstream (deductivist) eco- nomic modelling, in contrast, requires that strict event regularities (includ-ing those covered by well dened probabilistic laws) are ubiquitous. so thechoice, the dichotomy, is indeed between science being or not being exclu- sively the search for exceptionless regularities among observable events ,between the reductionist claims of dedu ctivism and non-reductionist claims of critical realism. hausman supposes that the thesis in question, that economists should abandon deductivism (as a universalising claim) for critical realism, some-how follows from a controversial metaphysics , which, 1) precisely mapsdistinctions in metaphysical categories onto those between observable and

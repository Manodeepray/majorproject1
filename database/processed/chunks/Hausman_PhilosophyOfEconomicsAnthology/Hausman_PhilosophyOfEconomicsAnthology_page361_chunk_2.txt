are not careless; theyare deviations from optimality attributed to decision costs. if subjects care lessabout getting it right when there are zero or low rewards, and decision is costly,this is because it is in their interest to care less. we canvass 31 studies in whichincreasing rewards relative to baseline either reduces the deviations of the dataaround the theorys prediction, or moves the central tendency of the data closertothis prediction. 8.of course, one can always offer the incredible argument that any recalcitrantcase would go away if you just made payoff opportunity cost large enough. butthis argument simply shows the limitations of a theory that postulates motivatedagents, but is devoid of all detail as to that motivation. auxiliary hypothesesin experimental economics that have to do with key issues involving the state ofthe agent like motivation and experience (learning), must ultimately be incor-porated into the theory, not banished to the realm of auxiliary hypotheses forthe experimentalists to worry about. 9.this is recognized by bicchieri ( 1988 ), brandenberger ( 1992 ), geanakoplos (1992 )and others when they model common knowledge as part of the the- ory of backward induction games. it is common for background assumptionevent ually to be made part of the theory. refere nces alger, dan, investigating oligopolies within the laboratory ,astaff report of the bureau of economics of the federal trade commission, washington, d.c., january 1986. aumann, robert j., game theory. in eatwell, john, murray milgate, and peter new- man, eds., the new palgrave: a dictionary of economics. 2. london: macmillian press ltd., 46082. bicchieri, cristina, backward inducti on without common knowledge, philosophy of science association ,1988, 2,32943.

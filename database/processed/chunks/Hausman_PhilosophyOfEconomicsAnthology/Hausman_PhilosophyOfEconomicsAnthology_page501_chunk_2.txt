of the experimental method. on this analogy, models are thought experiments. 13 butifathought experiment is to tell us anything about the real world (rather than merely about the structure of our own thoughts), our reasoningmust in some way replicate the workings of the world. for example, think how a structural engineer might use a theoretical model to test the strengthof a new design. this kind of modelling is possible in engineering becausethe theory which describes the general properties of the relevant class ofstructures is already known, even though its implications for the new struc-ture are not. provided the predictions of the general theory are true, theengineers thought experiment replicates a physical experiment that couldhave been carried out. on this interpretation, then, a model explains reality by virtue of the truth of the assumptions that it makes about the causal factors it has isolated. theisolations themselves may be unrealistic; in a literal sense, the assumptionswhich represent these isolations may be (and typically are) false. but theassumptions which represent the workings of the isolated causal factorsneed to be true. so, i suggest, the implications of the method of isolation fortheoretical modelling are broadly similar to the rst two steps of hausmansschema. that is, the modeller has to formulate credible generalizations con-cerning the operation of the factors that have been isolated, and then use

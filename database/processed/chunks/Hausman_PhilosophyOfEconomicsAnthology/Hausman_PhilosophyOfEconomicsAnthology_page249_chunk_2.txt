bentham and to condemn all other moral considerations as rhetorical nonsense nonsense upon stilts. so some strategy is inevitable whereby economists appraisepolicies, outcomes, and institutions other things being equal or alongjust one among several moral dimensions. the idea that there is, thus, a specically economic dimension of eval- uation determines the character of mainstream normative economics. it isthis idea that makes it possible to envision a normative economic theory , as opposed to a set of normatively motivated inquiries into consequencesand properties of economic policies and institutions. welfare economicsdepends not only on a specic view of welfare but also on the view thatinquiries into welfare can be separated from inquiries into freedom, rights,equality, and justice. in one way, this separation limits economists. theycan only appraise policies along one dimension or in one regard. but it alsofrees them from having to be concerned with anything but welfare. havingpassed the buck with respect to every thing except preference satisfaction, economists have only too often felt themselves free to ignore all other moralquestions and to exaggerate the signicance of their own partial mode ofevaluation. but even without this exaggeration, the notion that there is a separate dimension of economic evaluat ion is, as we shall see, questionable.

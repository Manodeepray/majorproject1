in some other existence it would allbe irrelevant. but if this is so, then we need a new term to designate whatis usually called historico-relative. so with that body of knowledge which isgeneral economics. if it is historico-relative, then a new term is needed todescribe what we know as historico-relative studies. stated this way, surely the case for the point of view underlying the so- called orthodox conception of the science since the time of senior andcairnes is overwhelmingly convincing. it is difcult to see why there shouldhave been such fuss, why anybody should have thought it worth while callingthe whole position in question. and, of course, if we examine the actualhistory of the controversy it becomes abundantly clear that the case forthe attack was not primarily scientic and philosophical at all. it may havebeen the case that from time to time a sensitive historian was outragedbythe crudities of some very second-rate economist more probably by some business man or politician repeating at second-hand what he thoughtthe economists had said. it may have been the case sometimes that a purelogician has been offended by an incautious use of philosophical terms onthe part of an economist, anxious to vindicate a body of knowledge whichhe knows to be true and important. but in the main the attacks have notcome from these quarters. rather they have been political in nature. they have come from men with an axe to grind from men who wished to pursuecourses which the acknowledgment of law in the economic sphere would have suggested to be unwise. this was certainly the case with the majority

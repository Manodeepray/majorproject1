far. ifakerlofs and schellings disclaimers were to be read as saying this work is conceptual exploration and nothing else , they would surely be disingenu-ous. we are being offered potential explanations of real-world phenomena.weare being encouraged to take these potential explanations seriously perhaps even to do some of the work necessary to turn these sketches oftheories into production models. if we are to do this, it is not enough thatwehave condence in the technical feasibility of an internally consistent theory. of course, having that condence is important, and we can get it byconceptual exploration of formal models. but what we need in addition is some condence that the production model is likely to do the job for whichit has been designed that it is likely to explain real-world phenomena.inother words, we need to see a sketch of an actual explanation, not just of a logically coherent formal structure. we should expect akerlofs andschellings models to provide explanations, however tentative and imper-fect, of regularities in the real world. i shall proceed on the assumption thatthese models are intended to function as such explanations. 5. instrumentalism this brings us back to the problem: how do unrealistic economic modelsexplain real-world phenomena?

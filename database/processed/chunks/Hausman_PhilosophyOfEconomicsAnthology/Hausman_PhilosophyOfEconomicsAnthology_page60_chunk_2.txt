causes we arelikely to nd, as shall induce us to look for them in the right quarter. but suchis the nature of human understanding, that the very fact of attending withintensity to one part of a thing, has a tendency to withdraw the attentionfrom the other parts. we are consequently in great danger of adverting to aportion only of the causes which are actually at work. and if we are in thispredicament, the more accurate our deductions and the more certain ourconclusions in the abstract (that is, making abstraction of all circumstances except those which form part of the hypothesis), the less we are likely to suspect that we are in error: for no one could have looked closely intothe sources of fallacious thinking without being deeply conscious that thecoherence, and neat concatenation of our philosophical systems, is more apt than we are commonly aware to pass with us as evidence of their truth. wecannot, therefore, too carefully endeavour to verify our theory, by comparing, in the particular cases to which we have access, the results which it would have led us to predict, with most trustworthy accounts we can obtainof those which have been actually realized. the discrepancy between ouranticipations and the actual fact is often the only circumstance which wouldhave drawn our attention to some important disturbing cause which we hadoverlooked. nay, it often discloses to us errors in thought, still more serious than the omission of what can with any propriety be termed a disturbingcause. it often reveals to us that the basis itself of our whole argument

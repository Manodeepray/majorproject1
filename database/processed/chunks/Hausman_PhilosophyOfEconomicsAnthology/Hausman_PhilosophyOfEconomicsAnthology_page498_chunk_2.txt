of the micro-situation are thought perhaps to explain it; a model is then constructed to provide the explanation. in other cases, an aspect of the micro-world is noticed, and a model is used to investigate the kinds of effects such a factor could be expected to have. (gibbard and hal varian 1978 :672) this seems a fair description of what b oth akerlof and schelling are doing. butgibbard and varian have disappointingly little to say about how acasual model explains an aspect of the real world, or how it allows us to investigate the likely effects of real-world factors on real-world phenomena. gibbard and varian recognize indeed, they welcome the fact that casual models are unrealistic; but their defence of this lack of realism is itself rather casual: when economic models are used in this way to explain casually observable features of the world, it is important that one be able to grasp the explanation. simplicity, then, will be a highly desirable feature of such models. complications to get as closeas possible a t to reality will be undesirable if they make the model less possible tograsp. such complications may, moreover, be unnecessary, since the aspects of the world the model is used to explain are not precisely measured.

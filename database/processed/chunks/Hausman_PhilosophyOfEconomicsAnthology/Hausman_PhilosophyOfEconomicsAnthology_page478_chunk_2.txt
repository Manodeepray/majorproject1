most highly regarded models imply that adults will, in fact, substitute away from goods consumed largely by children when they are present. second, while early empirical estimation of equivalence scalesdepended largely on prescriptive budget studies that listed how much eachtype of household would require for food, rent, and so on, more recent empirical practice has been characterized by greater subtlety and sophis-tication. unfortunately, the estimation of scales using large-scale demandsystem regressions informed by specic utility-theoretic models, which wasfor a period the norm, has for the most part turned out to be fundamentallyunderidentied (since the same demand equations may be consistent withany number of expenditure functions). while many economists have followed these trends to greater reliance on choice theory and advanced econometrics, a recent piece by trudi renwick and barbara bergmann ( 1993 )g i v e so n ei l l ustration of what can be accom- plished when the focus stays closer to the policy question, with less allegiancetoparticular models and methods. renwick and bergmanns formulation of basic needs budgets for households with different compositions fol-low the earlier prescriptive budgets approach, and is updated for changingtimes by the addition of childcare expenditures. while technically unso-phisticated, one may actually learn more about costs from such direct (if

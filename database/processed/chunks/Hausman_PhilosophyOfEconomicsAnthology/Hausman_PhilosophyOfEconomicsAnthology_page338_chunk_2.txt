conjecturing how these might be related to the preferences of the members of society. ramsey may well have thought (in the manner of keynes) that the wise men of cambridge couldbe trusted to know what was best for society independently of any directknowledge of the lower classes. push-pin may have been as good as poetryfor jeremy bentham; but bentham was an oxford man. in cambridge thepoets ruled and aspired to rule the world. on cambridge assumptions, thereis no problem with what ramsey did. bythe early 1950s, the general-equilibrium model had been more thor- oughly developed and analyzed. the two theorems of welfare economicswereestablished: 1. every perfectly competitive general equilibrium is pareto efcient; and2. every pareto-efcient allocation can be supported as a perfectly com- petitive equilibrium for some set of lump-sum transfers. these two theorems appear to promise an isomorphism between social planner problems that choose pareto-efcie nt allocations and perfectly com- petitive equilibria. in fact, this isomorphism provides a powerful technicaltool for the solution of dynamic optimization problems, because it is often

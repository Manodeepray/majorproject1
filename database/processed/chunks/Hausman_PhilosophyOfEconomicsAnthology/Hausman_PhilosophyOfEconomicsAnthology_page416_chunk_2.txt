attributes. they are social habits. for every individual their point of origin is in the mores of his community; and even these traditions haveanatural history and are subject to modication in the general process of social change. the idea that individual tastes are not given, but are shaped by institu- tional circumstances and by particular inuences such as advertising, is a major theme in the writings of galbraith. for instance, in the new ind ustrial state,galbraith [ 1969 ,152] insisted that individual wants can be synthe- sized by advertising, catalysed by salesmanship, and shaped by the discreetmanipulations of the persuaders. the theme persists throughout his writ-ings. indeed, no author has brought these ideas to the attention of themodern reader more clearly and resolutely than galbraith. his analysis putsparticular emphasis on the effects of advertising on individual wants. this isone version of the core institutionalist story. more generally, institutionalistsrecognize the potential inuence of many institutions on individual habits, conceptio ns, and preferences. suchideas permeate and endure through institutionalism as a whole. institutionalism is distinguished from both mainstream economics and the new institutional economics precisely for the reason that it does notassume a given individual, with given purposes or preference functions.

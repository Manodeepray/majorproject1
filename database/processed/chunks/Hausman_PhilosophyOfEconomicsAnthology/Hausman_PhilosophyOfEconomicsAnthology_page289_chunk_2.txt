variations in income-capability relations. since income is not desired for its own sake, any income-based notion of poverty must refer directly or indirectly to those basic ends whichare promoted by income as means. indeed, in poverty studies related toless developed countries, the poverty line income is often derived explicitlywith reference to nutritional norms. once it is recognized that the relation between income and capabilities varies between communities and betweenpeople in the same community, the minimally adequate income level forreaching the same minimally acceptable capability levels will be seen as variable depending on personal and social characteristics. however, aslong as minimal capabilities can be achieved by enhancing the income level(given the other personal and social characteristics on which capabilitiesdepend), it will be possible (for the specied personal and social charac-teristics) to identify the minimally adequate income for reaching the mini- mally acceptable capability levels. once this correspondence is established,it would not really matter whether poverty is dened in terms of a failure ofbasic capability or as a failure to have the corresponding minimally adequate income. 35

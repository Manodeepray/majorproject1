venture to suggest that theyare in fact entirely unwarranted by any doctrine of scientic economics, andthat outside this country they have very largely ceased to hold sway. the argument by which these propositions are supported is familiar: but it is worth while repeating it explicitly in order to show the exact points atwhich it is defective. the law of diminishing marginal utility implies thatthe more one has of anything the less one values additional units thereof.therefore, it is said, the more real income one has, the less one valuesadditional units of income. therefore the marginal utility of a rich mansincome is less than the marginal utility of a poor mans income. therefore, iftransfers are made, and these transfers do not appreciably affect production, total utility will be increased. therefore, such transfers are economically justied . quod erat demonstrandum. atrst sight the plausibility of the argument is overwhelming. but on closer inspection it is seen to be me rely specious. it rests upon an exten- sion of the conception of diminishing marginal utility into a eld in whichit is entirely illegitimate. the law of diminishing marginal utility hereinvoked does not follow in the least from the fundamental conception ofeconomic goods; and it makes assumptions which, whether they are true orfalse, can never be veried by observation o rintrospection. the proposition

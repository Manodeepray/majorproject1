cause is some other lawof human nature. in the latter case it never can fall within the provinceof political economy; it belongs to some other science; and here the merepolitical economist, he who has studied no science but political economy,if he attempt to apply his science to practice, will fail. 1 asfor the other kind of disturbing causes, namely those which operate through the same law of human nature out of which the general principlesof the science arise, these might always be brought within the pale of theabstract science if it were worth while; and when we make the necessaryallowances for them in practice, if we are doing anything but guess, weare following out the method of the abstract science into minuter details;inserting among its hypotheses a fresh and still more complex combinationof circumstances, and so adding pro h ac vice asupplementary chapter or appendix, or at least a supplementary theorem, to the abstract science. having now shown that the method ap rioriin political economy, and in all the other branches of moral science, is the only certain or scienticmode of investigation, and that the aposteriori method, or that of specic experience, as a means of arriving at truth, is inapplicable to these subjects, weshall be able to show that the latter method is notwithstanding of great value in the moral sciences; namely, not as a means of discovering truth,but of verifying it, and reducing to the lowest point that uncertainty beforealluded to as arising from the complexity of every particular case, and from

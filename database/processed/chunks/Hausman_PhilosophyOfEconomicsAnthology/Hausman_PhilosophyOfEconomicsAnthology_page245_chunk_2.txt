take human nature to be fundamentally rationalwould grow suspicious of the theory. mainstream economists in fact take the further step of assuming that people are in fact rational, at least to somereasonable degree of approximation. the standard formal theory of rationality does not go very far in esh- ing out explanatory individualism and a view of human nature as rational.without any general claims about the content of peoples preferences, very little can be predicted about how they will choose, and, in the wake of theirchoices, little can be said except that they chose as they preferred. positive economics becomes contentful only when economists offer generalizationsconcerning whatpeople prefer. the most important of these generalizations is that people are materially self-interested, that they prefer more commodi-ties to fewer, more wealth to less wealth. this generalization is so important,that one might reasonably think of it as a second general principle of humannature to which most mainstream economists are committed. inspeaking of rationality and self-interest as general principles of human nature to which economists subscribe, we do not mean to suggest thateconomists regard these principles as exceptionless general laws. just as onecan in various ways qualify the claim that individuals are rational, so one canhedge the claim that they are self-interested. economists may, for example,take self-interest to be a reasonable approximation rather than the literaltruth. economists can avoid dealing with the conicts between self-interest and concern for ones family by cheating on explanatory individualismand treating agents as households rather than as individuals. and so forth.

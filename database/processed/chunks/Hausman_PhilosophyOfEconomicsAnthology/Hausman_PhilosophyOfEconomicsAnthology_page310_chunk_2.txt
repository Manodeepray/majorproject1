be stable in the face of policy changes not accounted for inthe estimate. when seen in this light, the lucas critique clearly did not orig-inate with lucas and deserves to bear his name only because he broughtthe invariance problem home to most economists more forcibly than anyearlier author and because it serves as a convenient shorthand. lucas ( 1976 )himself claims no originality for the non-invariance argu- ment, suggesting that it is implicit in the work of frank knight, miltonfriedman and john muth. lucas does not, however, notice the explicit statement in trygve haavelmos famous paper, the probability approach ineconometrics ( 1944 ). haavelmo compares the estimation of simple econo- metric relations to working out the relation between the amount of throttleand the speed of a car on a at track und er uniform conditions. the relation may be precise; but change the surrounding conditions (e.g., take the car offthe track or allow the engine to get out of tune), and the relation will almostcertainly break down. haavelmo ( 1944 :28) contrasts the lack of autonomy of such empirical regularities with such things as the laws of thermodynamics,friction and so forth, which are autonomous because they describe the func-tioning of some parts of the mechanism irrespective of what happens in some other parts . what haavelmo suggests, in the terminology of zellner ( 1979 ), is that non-autonomous relations are not lawlike; they do not represent the

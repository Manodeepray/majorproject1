kinds of reasoners: there is one portion who termthemselves practical men, and call the others theorists; a title which the latter do not reject, though they by no means recognize it as peculiar tothem. the distinction between the two is a very broad one, though it isone of which the language employed is a most incorrect exponent. it hasbeen again and again demonstrated, that those who are accused of despisingfacts and disregarding experience build and profess to build wholly uponfacts and experience; while those who disavow theory cannot make one stepwithout theorizing. but, although both classes of inquirers do nothing but theorize, and both of them consult no other guide than experience, thereis this difference between them, and a most important difference it is: thatthose who are called practical men require specic experience, and argue wholly upwards from particular facts to a general conclusion; while those who are called theorists aim at embracing a wider eld of experience, and,having argued upwards from particular facts to a general principle includingamuch wider range than that of the question under discussion, then argue downwards from that general principle to a variety of specic conclusions. suppose, for example, that the question were, whether absolute kings werelikely to employ the powers of government for the welfare or for the oppression of their subjects. the practicals would endeavour to determinethis question by a direct induction fr om the conduct of particular despotic monarchs, as testied by history. the theorists would refer the question to be

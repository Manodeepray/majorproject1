a tree is a special case,has more implications capable of being contradicted, and has failed to becontradicted under a wider variety of circumstances. the direct evidence for the growth of leaves is in this way strengthened by the indirect evidencefrom the other phenomena to which the more general theory applies. the constructed hypothesis is presumably valid, that is, yields suf- ciently accurate predictions about the density of leaves, only for a partic-ular class of circumstances. i do not know what these circumstances are orhow to dene them. it seems obvious, however, that in this example theassumptions of the theory will play no part in specifying them: the kind of tree, the character of the soil, etc., are the types of variables that are likelytodene its range of validity, not the ability of the leaves to do complicated mathematics or to move from place to place. alargely parallel example involving human behavior has been used else- where by savage and me. 15consider the problem of predicting the shots made by an expert billiard player. it seems not at all unreasonable that excel-lent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard playermade his shots as if he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum directions of travel, could estimate accurately by eyethe angles, etc., describing the location of the balls, could make lightning calculations from the formulas, and could then make the balls travel in thedirection indicated by the formulas. our condence in this hypothesis isnot based on the belief that billiard players, even expert ones, can or do go

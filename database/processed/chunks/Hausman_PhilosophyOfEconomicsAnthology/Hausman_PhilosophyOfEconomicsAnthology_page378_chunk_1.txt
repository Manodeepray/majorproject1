(the game is like secu- rityanalysts who know more about the value of a stock than you do, make a recommendation, and want you to act as if the stock is morevaluable than it is, because of career concerns or other collateral inter-ests.) in the interesting conditions, the senders earn the most if thereceiver chooses s b,w h e r e bis a known bias parameter (either 1 or 2). we try to predict the true state from the senders message m, and from their pupil dilation (expansion of pupils) when they sendtheir message. pupils dilate under arousal, stress and deception (thatis why poker players wear sunglasses if they are allowed to).

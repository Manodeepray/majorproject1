(it is not as if the moon would like to leave its orbit around the earth,but is forbidden to do so by a gravitational edict.) scientic laws are instead(speaking roughly) regularities in nature. but they are not just regularities.consider the generalization, no gold nugget weighs more than 1,000 tons. even if it is true everywhere and for all time, this generalization appears to be merely accidental and of no explanatory value. what then is the differencebetween an accidental regularity and a genuine law? rather than canvas the unsatisfactory answers philosophers have con- sidered, let us step back and ask whether, however the analysis comes out,economics has any genuine laws. consider, for example, the law of demand.itsays, roughly, that when the price of something goes down, people seek to buy more of it, and when the price goes up, people want to buy less. unlikephysical laws such as boyles law, which states that the pressure and volumeof a gas are inversely proportional, the law of demand is asymmetrical: itlinks causes

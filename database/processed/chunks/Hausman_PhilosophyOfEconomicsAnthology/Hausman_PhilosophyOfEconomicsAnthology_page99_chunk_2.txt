the theory of exchange assumes that ican compare the importance to me of bread at 6d. per loaf and 6d. spent on other alternatives presented by the opportunities of the market. and it assumes that the order ofmypreferences thus exhibited can be compared with the order of preferences of the baker. but it does notassume that, at any point, it is necessary to compare the satisfaction which iget from the spending of 6d. on bread with the satisfaction which the baker gets by receiving it. that comparison is a comparison of an entirely different nature. it is a comparison which isnever needed in the theory of equilibrium and which is never implied by theassumptions of that theory. it is a comparison which necessarily falls outsidethe scope of any positive science. t o state that as preference stands abovebs in order of importance is entirely different from stating that a prefersntomandbp r e f e r s nand min different order. it involves an element of conventional valuation. hence it is essentially normative. it has no place in pure science. ifthis is still obscure, the following consideration should be decisive. suppose that a difference of opinion were to arise about as preferences. suppose that i thought that, at certain prices, he preferred ntom,and you thought that, at the same prices, he preferred mton.itwould be easy to settle our differences in a purely scientic manner. either we could ask atotell us. or, if we refused to believe that introspection on as part was

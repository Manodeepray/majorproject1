note ( 1984 ,pp.169ff.), produces a unique and irreversible history path along which the systemevolves. what is suggested here is a generalized perspective that brings into focus creativity and open-endedness in the ev olution of nonequilibrium systems, aperspective that has as its leitmotiv that the future is not given (pri- gogine, 1986 ,p.493), but is created in an unfolding evolutionary process. 3 authors like p . m. allen ( 1988 ,p .9 9 ) and j. s. wicken ( 1987 ,p .3 )s p e a k of a new evolutionary synthesis ,aunied view of the world which bridges the gap between the physical and the human sciences (allen, 1988 ,p.118). inhis discussion on the relevance of the new evolutionary synthesis for economic theory, allen stresses the concern with microscopic diversity as the critical feature. the cloudy, confused complexity of the real world ( 1988 , p.99) is the essential subject of an evolutionary approach in contrast to aperspective that looks for types and classes, and that views microscopic diversity and variation as negligible aberrations, to be averaged out throughclassication and aggregation. 4variability and individual diversity at the microscopic level drive evolutionary processes; they are the crucial ingre-dient to the creativity of these processes, of their potential to generatenovelty. as allen ( 1988 ,p.108) puts it: the uctuations, mutations and

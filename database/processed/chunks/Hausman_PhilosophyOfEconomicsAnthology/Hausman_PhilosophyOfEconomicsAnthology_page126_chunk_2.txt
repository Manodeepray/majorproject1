is the contra diction of estranged labour with itself and that political economy has merely formulated laws of estranged labour. it,therefore, follows for us that wages and private property are identical: for there the product, the object of labour, pays for the labour itself, wagesare only a necessary consequence of the estrangement of labour; similarly,where wages are concerned, labour appears not as an end in itself but as theservant of wages. we intend to deal with this point in more detail later on:for the present we shall merely draw a few conclusions. 5 anenforced rise in wages (disregarding all other difculties, including the fact that such an anomalous situation could only be prolonged by force)would therefore be nothing more than better pay for slaves and would not mean an increase in human signicance or dignity for either the worker orthe labour. even the equality of wages, which proudhon demands, would merely transform the relation of the present-day worker to his work into the relation of all men to work. society would then be conceived as an abstract capitalist. wages are an immediate consequence of estranged labour, and estranged labour is the immediate cause of private property. if the one falls, then theother must fall too.

regard the representative-agent model as an idealization? it may be a good way to think about macroeconomic problemswhen the losses due to aggregation are relatively small. let us accept that, butnotice that whether or not the representative-agent model is a good thingdepends now entirely on its contingent empirical success. it may work; itmay solve the lucas critique; it may not. we just have to see. there is nolonger a point of principle involved. the advocate of the representative-agent model has no right to attack other macroeconomists for failing toprovide microfoundations, for he fails to provide genuine microfoundationshimself. myguess is that the representative-agent model may help in pointing to some sorts of qualitatively useful relationships. but it is unlikely to provideuseful quantitative restrictions on the behavior of macroeconomic aggre-gates. the reason can be seen by thinking about the way in which marshallused the idea of the representative, rm. for marshall, the representativerm was not the average, or even median, rm, but a rm that typiedrms at a point in their life cycle at which the extreme behaviors associatedwith very small or very young rms, on the one hand, or very large or very old rms, on the other hand, could be set aside. if we can analogize back to

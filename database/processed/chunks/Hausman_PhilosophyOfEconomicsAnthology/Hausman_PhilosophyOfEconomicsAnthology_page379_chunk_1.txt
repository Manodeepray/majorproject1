(2005) and knoch etal.(2006) used repetitive tms to disrupt the dlpfc when people received offers. based on the fmri evidence, theyhypothesised that if the dlpfc is disrupted, the socialised response to unfairness which leads to rejection may be turned off, so that peoplewill exhibit more innate selshness and accept lower offers more often. their prediction was correct. the effects are small and come from onlytwo studies with modest sample sizes, but they show the power of atwo-step process: rst establish parts of neural circuitry that implementabehaviour; then stimulate or disrupt some of those parts and if see if youcancause abehavioural change. 4. oxytocin is a powerful hormone in social bonding (e.g., it surges when mothers breast-feed; and synthetic oxytocin pitocin is administeredin american hospitals to stimulate childbirth). direct measurementfrom blood samples (zak etal.,2005) suggests oxytocin is important in trust. inspired by this evidence, kosfeld etal.(2005)

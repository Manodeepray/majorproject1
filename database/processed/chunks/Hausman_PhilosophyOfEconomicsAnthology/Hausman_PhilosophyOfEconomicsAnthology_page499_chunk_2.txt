clearly, akerlof and schelling are claiming that the real world is like their models in some signicant respects. w hat is at issue is what exactly these claims amount to, and how (if at all) they can be justied. translating intomccloskeys language, what is at issue is how illuminating and how apt akerlofs and schellings metaphors are. but this translation of the question does not take us any nearer to an answer. gibbard and varian ( 1978 )come closer to giving an answer to this question (at this stage, i do not say the right answer) when they suggestthat models are caricatures. the concept of caricature is tighter than that of metaphor, since the ingredients of a caricature must be taken from thecorresponding reality. (compare cartoons john bull, the fat, beef-eating yeoman farmer, was originally a caricature of a characteristic englishman. although no longer a valid caricature, he is still recognizable as a symbolof, or metaphor for, englishness.) according to gibbard and varian, theassumptions of a model may be chosen not to approximate reality, but toexaggerate or isolate some feature of reality (p. 673). the aim is to distort reality in a way that illuminates certain aspects of that reality (p. 676). the idea that models are caricatures suggests that models may be able to explain the real world because their assumptions describe certain features of that world, albeit in isolated or exaggerated form. gibbard and varian donot pursue this idea very far, but it is taken up in different ways by hausman(1992 :123151) and by uskali m aki ( 1992 ,1994 ), whose work will now be discussed.

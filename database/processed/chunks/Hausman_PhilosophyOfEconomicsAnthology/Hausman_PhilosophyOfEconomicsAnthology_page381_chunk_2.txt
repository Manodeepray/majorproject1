dothe same? of course, theories that spring from the fertile mind of a theoristwho is simply inspired by psychology, but is not beholden to a large bodyof facts, could prove to be useful theories too. but theories that can explainneural facts and choices should have some advantage over theories which explain only choices, if they are comparably tractable. morefundamentally, the argument against neuroeconomics (or the case for mindless economics, as their papers title calls it) rests mostly on aninteresting hope, and rests a little bit on the history of economic thought.the hope is that all anomalies produced by behavioural economics and neu-roeconomics can be explained (if not predicted) by the enriched language of economics preferences, beliefs, and imperfect information and con-straint. i share that hope, but only if some imperfections and constraints areallowed to be located in the brain in which case, brain evidence is usefulfor understanding those imperfections and constraints and suggesting thebest models of them.

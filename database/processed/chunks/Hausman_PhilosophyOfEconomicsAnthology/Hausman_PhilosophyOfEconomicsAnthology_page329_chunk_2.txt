levels is larger here than it is with respect to the gaslaws. seeing a beautiful woman does not seem to be the same kind of thingas any pattern of neuron rings. vision and, to a greater degree, aestheticappreciation appear to be emergent prop erties, even if there is a reduction. the situation is even more complex than that. y ou and i can see the same thing even though our brain states are not the same. similarly, you can seethe same thing at different times even though your brain state is different ateach time. there is no one-to-one mapping between the macro phenomenaof mind and the micro phenomena of brain states. this observation has ledtothe notion of supervenience. mental states are said to supervene on brain states in the sense that any time one could exactly reproduce a certain brainstate and collateral conditions, the same mental state would occur, eventhough that mental state may occur for other congurations of brain statesas well, and even though the appropriate phenomenological descriptionsof the mental state are completely different from those of the brain states.supervenience guarantees the autonomy of the macro level in the sense that it ensures that one can rationally use an independent language andcategories to describe the macro level and that one should not expect to ndunique deductions from the micro to the macro. y et, it also underscores theconnection between the micro and the macro: no macro state exists unless an appropriate micro state exists. supervenience has been offered both as a

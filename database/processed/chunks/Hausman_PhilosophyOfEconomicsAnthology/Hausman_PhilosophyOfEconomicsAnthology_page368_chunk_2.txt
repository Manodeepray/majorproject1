theory can be adapted to study the brain asan organisation of interacting comp onents. fudenberg and levine (forth- coming) emphasise the struggle between a long-run player and a short-run player, adapted from game-theoretic models (see also shefrin and thalersprescient, 1988, planner-doer model). 1benhabib and bisin (2005) empha- sise the constraint that controlled executive processes put on automaticprocesses. bernheim and rangel (forthcoming) emphasise hot impulsivestates (akin to automatic process, but perhaps driven by visceral factors likedrug craving or hunger) and cold states. loewenstein and odonoghue(2004) emphasise deliberate processes and affective ones. brocas and car-illo (2005) emphasise how a cortical control process constrains an emotionalprocess which may be asymmetrically informed. so far, there is little directneural evidence testing these various models and comparing them. doingso is an obvious immediate direction for research (and will contribute tobasic neuroscience as well). itis important to note that the focus of neuroeconomic research so far is largely on microeconomics foundations of consumer choice, valuing risky gambles, and strategic thinking. it remains to be seen whether neural mea-surement will be useful for understanding macroeconomic phenomena likeconsumer condence or stock market bubbles. however, many of these

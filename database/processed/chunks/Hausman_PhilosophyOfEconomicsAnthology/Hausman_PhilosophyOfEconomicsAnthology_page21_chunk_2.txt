observations or experiences could ever lead us to believe that such propositions were false. modern physics has not dealt kindly with kants view that the axioms of euclidean geometry are ap rioritruths, but the kantian view that there are synthetic ap rioritruths still has supporters among so-called austrian economists, especially ludwig von mises and his followers. they argue thatthe fundamental postulates of economics are synthetic ap rioritruths. 11i shall not discuss the austrians epistemological views, but the reader shouldbe aware that some methodologists question empiricist views on assessment. despite their obviousness, empiricist views of the assessment of claims about the world encounter serious problems. first, it seems implausible toclaim that denitional truths such as triangles have three angles requiretesting or that our condence in such claims rests on the results of obser- vations. nor do we need experiments to know that a claim such as thissquare is circular is false. the logical positivists responded by distinguishingsynthetic claims claims about the world from analytic or contradictoryclaims whose truth or falsity depend solely on logic and on the meanings ofthe terms in such claims. 12

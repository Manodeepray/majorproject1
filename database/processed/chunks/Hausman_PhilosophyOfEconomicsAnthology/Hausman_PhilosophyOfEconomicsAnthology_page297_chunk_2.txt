of uncertainty regarding ones own future preference by valuing instrumentally the advantage of having more options in the future. on themotivational contrasts, see sen ( 1985 a,1985 b). 26.aswas argued in an earlier paper, the good life is partly a life of genuine choice, and not one in which the person is forced into a particular life however richit might be in other respects (sen, 1985 b:6970). 27.see sen ( 1985 b,1988 a,1991 ), suppes ( 1987 ), pattanaik and xu ( 1990 ). 28.the characteristics and relevance of rened functioning have been discussedin sen ( 1985 a,1988 a). 29.these issues are discussed in sen ( 1985 a,1987 b). 30.the basic needs literature is extensive. for a helpful introduction, see streetenetal.(1981 ). in a substantial part of the literature, there is a tendency to dene basic needs in the form of needs for commodities (e.g. for food, shelter, clothing, health care), and this may distract attention from the fact that these commodi-ties are no more than the means toreal ends (inputs for valuable functionings and capabilities). on this question, see streeten ( 1984 ). the distinction is par- ticularly important since the relationship between commodities and capabilities may vary greatly between individuals even in the same society (and of coursebetween different societies). for example, even for the elementary function-ing of being well-nourished, the relation between food intake and nutritionalachievements varies greatly with metabolic rates, body size, gender, pregnancy,age, climatic conditions, epidemiological characteristics, and other factors (on these and related matters see dr eze and sen, 1989 ). the capability approach can accommodate the real issues underlying, the concern for basic needs, avoidingthe pitfall of commodity fetishism . 31.the importance of socially recognized ideas of urgency has been illuminatingly discussed by thomas scanlon (1975). 32.on this see sen ( 1980 ).

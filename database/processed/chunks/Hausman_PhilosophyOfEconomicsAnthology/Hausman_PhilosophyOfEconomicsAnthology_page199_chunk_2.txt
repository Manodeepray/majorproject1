with the evidence, then theconjecture is falsied and it should be replaced by a new conjecture which is not ad hoc relative to the original, that is, the new conjecture should not be contrived solely to avoid this empirical anomaly. 5ifthe theory is not falsied bythe evidence then it is considered corroborated and it is accepted pro- visionally. given poppers fallibilism this acceptance is provisional forever; the method does not necessarily result in true theories, only ones that havefaced a tough empirical opponent and won. nowwhile there are a number of reasons why economists have felt that popperian falsicationism would be a desirable methodology, the fact is that falsicationism is seldom if ever practised in economics .this seems to be the one point generally agreed upon by recent methodological commentators.infact, this (empirical) claim is supported at length by the case studies in blaug ( 1980 ), a book which consistently advocates falsicationism as a normative ideal. the disagreement between critics and defenders of falsi-cationism is not whether it has been practised ,basically it has not, but rather whether it should be practised .the real questions are whether the profession should try harder to practise falsicationism though it has failed to doso in the past, and the related question of whether the discipline of eco-nomics would be substantially improved by a conscientious falsicationistpractice.

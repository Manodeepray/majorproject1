of these quantiers is necessary for ontological realism; none of them should be included in the denition of realism. it is sufcientfor realism about xtohold that xmight exist, that the notion of xexisting is a sensible and coherent notion. this raises the key issue concerning theappropriate concepts of existence. specication of the types and numbers of entities that are claimed to exist is not sufcient for a complete understanding of ontological realism. itis necessary to specify what is meant by the expressions exists and is real . the rst decision to be made about this question concerns whether there is an ontological notion of exists and is real that is conceptuallyindependent of epistemic considerations and of specic conceptual frame-worksinwhich the specications of x appear; that is, whether in addition toac oncept of existence within a framework there is a sensible and x framework-independent concept for expressing the idea that x exists (ordoes not exist). for example, the question may be whether the meaning ofexist in the statement, photons exist , may be understood independently of the meaning of the term photon and of the specic theoretical frameworksin which photon is embedded and of the epistemic claims we may feel tobe justied in making about the existence of photons (such as the evidence

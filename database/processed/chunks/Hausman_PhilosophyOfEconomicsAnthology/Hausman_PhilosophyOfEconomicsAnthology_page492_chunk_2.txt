of squares. the dimes and pennies: represent the members of two homogeneous groups men and women, blacks and whites, french-speaking and english-speaking, ofcers and enlisted men, students and faculty, surfers and swimmers, the well dressed and the poorly dressed, or any other dichotomy that is exhaustive and recognizable. (schelling 1978 :147) wethen distribute coins over the squares of the grid. each square must either be allocated one coin or left empty (it is important to leave some empty spaces). next, we postulate a condition which determines whether a coin iscontent with its neighbourhood. for example, we might specify that a coin is content provided that at least one-third of its neighbours (that is, coins onhorizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent squares) are of the same type as itself. then we look for coins which are not content. whenever we nd suchacoin, we move it to the nearest empty square at which it isconten t( e v e n if, in so doing, we make other coins discontented). this continues untilthere are no discontented coins. schelling suggests that we try this withdifferent initial distributions of coins and different rules. what we will nd,he says, is a very strong tendency for the emergence of sharply segregateddistributions of coins, even when the condition for contentedness is quiteweak. i have followed schellings instructions (with the help of a computer program rather than paper and coins), and i can conrm that he is right.clearly, schelling expects that after we have watched the workings of this

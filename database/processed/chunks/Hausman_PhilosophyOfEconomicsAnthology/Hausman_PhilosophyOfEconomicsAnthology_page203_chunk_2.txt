treated as irrefutable by the programmespractitioners. t o participate in the programme is to accept and be guided bythe programmes hard core. for example, in weintraubs lakatosian recon-struction of the neo-walrasian research programme in economics, the hardcoreconsists of propositions such as: agents have preferences over outcomes and agents act independently and optimize subject to constraints. the pos-itive and negative heuristics provide instructions about what should andshould not be pursued in the development of the programme. the positiveheuristic guides the researcher toward the right questions and the best toolstouse in answering those questions; the negative heuristic indicates what questions should not be pursued and what tools are inappropriate. againusing weintraubs analysis of the neo-walrasian programme as an example,the positive heuristic contains injunctions such as: construct theories wherethe agents optimize, while the negative heuristic implores researchers toavoid theories involving disequilibrium. finally, the protective belt consists of the programmes actual theories, auxiliary hypotheses, empirical con-ventions and the (evolving) body of the research programme. the major activity of the programme occurs in the protective belt, it occurs as a resultof the interaction of the hard core, the heuristics, and the programmes

predict, and the only (or only acceptable) data.11the neoclassical theory is just a compact description of a set of predictions. t o ask whetherits assumptions are realistic is either to make a category mistake (becauseassumptions do not refer to anything that has real existence) or to miss thepoint (because, although assumptions refer to real things, the truth or falsityof those references has no bearing on the value of the theory). butisitpossible to understand akerlofs and schellings models instru- mentally? these models are certainly similar to the neoclassical model ofmarkets in their use of highly simplied assumptions which, if taken literally,are highly unrealistic. but if these models are intended to be read instrumen-tally, we should expect to nd them being used to generate unambiguouspredictions about the real world. further, there should be a clear distinctionbetween assumptions (which either have no truth values at all, or are allowedtobe false) and predictions (which are asserted to be true). infact, neither akerlof nor schelling proposes any explicit and testable hypothesis about the real world. nor does either theorist maintain an instru- mentalist distinction between assumptions and predictions. akerlofs case studies seem to be intended as much to persuade us of the credibility ofhis assumptions about asymmetric information as to persuade us that thevolume of trade is sub-optimal. as i have already said, schellings discussion

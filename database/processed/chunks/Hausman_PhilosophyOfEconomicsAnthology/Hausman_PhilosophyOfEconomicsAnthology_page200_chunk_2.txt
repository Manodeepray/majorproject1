controlled laboratory environment. 8inthe presence of such a variety of restrictions it is vir- tually impossible to aim the arrow of modus tollens atone particular problematic element of the set auxiliary hypotheses when contrary evi-dence is found. second, there are many questions and disagreementsabout the empirical basis in economics. it is always possible to arguethat what was observed was not really involuntary unemployment ornot really economic prot, etc. although it is fundamental to pop- perian philosophy that the empirical basis need not be incorrigible,it is necessary that there be a generally accepted convention regard-ing the empirical basis, 9and in economics even such conventions are often not available. third, even if these rst two problems have some-how been eliminated it is still possible for the social sciences to havefeedback effects that do not exist in the physical sciences. the test ofan economic theory may itself alter the initial conditions for the test.conducting a test of the relationship between the money supply and the price level may alter expectations in such a way that the initialconditions (which were true initially) are not true after the test (or if the same test were conducted again).

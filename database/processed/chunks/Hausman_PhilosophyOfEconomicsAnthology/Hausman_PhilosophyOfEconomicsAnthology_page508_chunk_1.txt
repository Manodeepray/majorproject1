(moreshowy theorists than schelling would probably draw the checkerboard onatorus, so that it had no edges at all; this would give us a city located on a doughnut-shaped planet.) this pr operty of repeatingness makes the analysis of the model much easier than it otherwise would be. but it doesnot seem right to say that the checkerboard isolates some aspect of real cities by sealing off various other factors which operate in reality: just whatdo we have to seal off to make a real city say, norwich become like acheckerboard? notice that, in order to arrive at the checkerboard plan, it is not enough just to suppose that all locations are identical with one another(that is, to use a generic concept of location): we need to use a particular form of generic location. so, i suggest, it is more natural to say

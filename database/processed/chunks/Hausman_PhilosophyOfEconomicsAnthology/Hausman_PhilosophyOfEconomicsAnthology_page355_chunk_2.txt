circumstances, economic theorypredicts shortages, an increase in prices toward the new market clearing lev-els, and eventually an increase in output. however, economic theory doesnot predict the verbal behavior of agents in this process so such expressionsdo not falsify the theory. do expressions of unfairness reect interpersonal utilities that reduce effective demand for the product of offending parties, or do they vent theunpleasant need for expectations to be adjusted? if such results show no morethan a lag as aggrieved parties adjust their expectations to the new reality,the standard models will predict the eventual result, as the indignation sub-sides. but protesting parties may react strategically in their self-interest bywithholding demand and punishing price gougers, or, fearing this, sellers may moderate or forgo their increase in prices. alternatively, by way of con-temporary contract theory, one side or the other may see the reference price and transactions as an implicit contract, not to be lightly tampered with. ifan economic agent can extract resources by claiming unfair treatment, thenit is consistent with standard theory for the agent to manufacture wordstothat effect. in such situations, it isnt clear that standard self-interested utility-maximizing models can account fully for the observed marketbehavior.

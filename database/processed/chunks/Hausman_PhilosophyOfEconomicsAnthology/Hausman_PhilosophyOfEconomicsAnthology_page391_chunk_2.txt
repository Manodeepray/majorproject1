aspects of the same general theme that marks the critical difference between the subjectivist perspectiveand its neoclassical counterpart. it marks the difference between the non- teleological outlook on the human social realm that informs the subjectivist notion of an open-ended, creative-choice process, and the teleological thrust that underlies, if only implicitly, the neoclassical notion of an equilibriumsolution that is preordained by patterns of mineral resources, geography,population, consumer tastes and technological possibilities (arthur, 1990 , p.99). 15toshackle and other radical subjectivists, the whole general equi- librium concept is questionable when applied to a constantly changing socialworld that has no predeterminable telos, whether in the pompous sense of amarxian philosophy of history or in the more pedestrian sense of a con- ceptually denable equilibrium toward which the process of socioeconomic change could be predicted to gravitate. in a world in which creative human choice is a constant source of an unknowable future, the notion of a social equilibrium is, in j. wisemans words, a pseudo-concept ( 1989 ,p.214), one that can have only the most tenuous general meaning ( ibid. ,p.265). 16 another way of stating the subjectivist objection against the neoclassical equilibrium concept is by saying that the latter does not provide for an ade-quate account of real historical time. it does not take seriously the factthat, as l. m. lachmann puts it, time and knowle dgebelong together (1977 ,p.85), that time cannot pass without modifying knowledge ( ibid. , p.93). 17the common argument that simplifying assumptions allow

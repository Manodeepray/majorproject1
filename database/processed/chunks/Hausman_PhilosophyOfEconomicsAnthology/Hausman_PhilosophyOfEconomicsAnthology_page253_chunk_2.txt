it is possible in some sense for the winners in a change from ytox tocompensate the losers. whether the winners could compensate the losers is then operationalized in terms of willingness to pay. if the amount thatwinners would be willing to pay to bring about a policy is larger than the amount that losers would need to be compensated to accept the policy, thenthe policy is a potential pareto improvement over the status quo, and thepolicy purportedly brings about a more efcient state of affairs in whichthere is a net benet a greater capacity to satisfy preferences. all thingsconsidered, the policy might be a bad thing, because of its distributional consequences. but the distributional questions are not questions with which economists have any particular expertise. furthermore, if the problems aredistributional, then so are the solutions. the judgment concerning economicefciency stands. there are many problems with this argument, and many of these prob- lems are inherited by the practical implementation of this line of thoughtin contemporary cost-benet analysis. the central problem is that the sep-aration that kaldor and hicks envisioned between questions concerningefciency and distribution, between the size of the pie and the way it issliced is not in general to be had. kaldor and hickss analysis would work if the utility frontiers were like those depicted in figure 13.1,which represents the case of the loaves of

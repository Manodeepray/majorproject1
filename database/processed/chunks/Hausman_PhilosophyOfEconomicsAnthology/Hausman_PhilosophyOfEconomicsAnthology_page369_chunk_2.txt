also implies thatthe right kinds of models are computational ones in which well-understoodcomponents collaborate to create behaviour. attention and consciousness are scarce, and the brain is evolved to off- load decisions by automating activity through learning. automaticity meansthat people are capable of creating tremendous expertise which relies on sub-conscious intuition and pattern recognition. it also means that overcoming automated behaviour takes scarce conscious effort and is often a source ofmistakes in stroop tasks . 2 the human brain is basically the primate brain with extra neocortex; and the primate brain is a simpler mammalian brain with some neocortex. thisevolutionary history is the main reason why experiments with animals are so informative about human behaviour. (t o think otherwise is economic cre-ationism.) for example, rats become biologically addicted to all substancesthat humans become addicted to (nicotine, opiates, alcohol etc.). our sharedevolutionary past, and inherited brain regions, do not imply that humans always behave like monkeys (though we sometimes do). our shared past just

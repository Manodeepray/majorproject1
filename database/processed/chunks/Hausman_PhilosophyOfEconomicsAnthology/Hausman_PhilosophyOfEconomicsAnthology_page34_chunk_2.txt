eventually the rate of prots will decline to the pointwhere it is no longer worthwhile for capitalists to invest at all. in the resultingstationary state, there are more workers, but they are no better off than their predecessors, since their wages will decline to that point where popula- tion no longer increases. capitalists are better off than workers, but the rateof prot is low and their returns are modest. the big winners are landlords,who do nothing but collect rents. there is, in the view of most classicaleconomists, little to do about this gloomy prospect except to agitate for theelimination of tariffs impeding the impor tation of foodstuffs and to preach restraint to the working class. fortunately, things did not turn out as ricardo predicted. with improve- ments in the standard of living, population growth slowed, and by the latenineteenth century, economists recognized that population need not growexplosively in response to higher wages. moreover, technological improve- ments brought about increases in productivity beyond the wildest dreamsof the classical economists, who vastly underestimated the ability of tech-nological improvements to stave off diminishing returns. bythe end of the nineteenth century, economics was no longer such adismal science. economists for the most part stopped worrying about population growth, and through the so-called neoclassical or marginal

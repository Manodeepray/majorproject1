egate perfectly by counting bundles of hydrogen and oxygen into bundles: 2h 1o 1 water bundle. generally, however, except in these extreme cases, perfect aggregation is not possible. the reason is economic. if goods are neither perfect comple-ments (in which case no change in the mix of the goods is possible) norperfect substitutes (in which case no change in the mix of goods matters),then the mix of goods can be changed and still yield the same output orutility. how that mix changes depends on relative prices. as the price of agood rises, we purchase less of that good and more of its substitute. thisis the basis for the common claim, going back to hicks, that we can treatbundles of goods as composite commodities, so long as their relative pricesdo not change: the so-called composite commodity theorem. 15 the composite commodity theorem is true as far as it goes, but notice how special are the assumptions on which it is based. we generally regardprices not as exogenous variables given outside the economic system, but asone of the important products of economic coordination. the proofs of theexistence of a general equilibrium, going back to kenneth arrow and gerard debreu, demonstrate that there is a set of prices that coordinates economicactivity. the prices are not themselves parameters, but change as the trueparameters (tastes and technology, if we go back to lucass formulation)change. the composite commodity theorem, therefore, holds only when

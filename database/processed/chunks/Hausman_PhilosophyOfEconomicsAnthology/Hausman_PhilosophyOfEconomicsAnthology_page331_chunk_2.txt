large-scale macroe conometric forecasting models on the basis that their equations captured transitory correlations in thedata that would not remain stable in the face of changes in policy regimes.hisidea is that people make choices subject to constraints that include their best expectations of government policy. if the government uses themacroeconomic models to guide its policy choices, it will surely nd thatthe models fail as soon as it changes its policy, because agents will adapt tothe constraints of the new policy. projecting macroeconomic relationshipsestimated in the past into the future implicitly assumes that the policy ofthe past continues. but if the government uses those projections to guidechanges in its policy, then it assumes that people expect the old policy, even while a new policy is in place. people are not stupid, so the past projectionsare bound to fail. the most common response to the lucas critique (forexample, in the program of lars peter hansen and thomas sargent and, more recently, in real-business-cycle models) was to argue that economicprojections would be secure only if they were grounded in a deep analy-sis of the decision, problems faced by individuals, including their detailedunderstanding of the structure of policy. 14am odel was said to be secure from the lucas critique only if it was grounded in relationships built upfrom the deep parameters corresponding to tastes and technology. only

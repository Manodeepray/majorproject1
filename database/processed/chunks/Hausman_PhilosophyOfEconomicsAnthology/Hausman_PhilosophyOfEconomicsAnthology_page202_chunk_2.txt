well-known (non novel) facts, or alternatively, with explaining known phenomena by means of fewer theoretical restric- tions. what constitutes progress in economic theory (or what shouldconstitute progress) is a complex and ongoing question, but it is appar- ent that any suitable answer will require a different, and possibly muchmore liberal, set of standards than those offered by strict popperianfalsicationism. all of these criticisms add up to a negative appraisal of falsicationist eco-nomic methodology. despite the fact that preaching falsicationist method-ology has been very popular among economists, the method fails to provideareasonably adequate set of rules for do ing economics. strict adherence to falsicationist norms would virtually destroy all existing economic theory and leave economists with a rule book for a game unlike anything the professionhas played in the past. this high cost would be paid without any guaranteethat obeying the new rules would result in theories any closer to the truthabout economic behaviour than those currently available. how this resultshould be interpreted will be discussed in the conclusion, for now let us turntolakatoss msrp.

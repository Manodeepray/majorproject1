peoples economic choices. some preferences, such aspreferences for communities free of urban sprawl, are hard to signal whenone buys groceries, cars or even homes. furthermore, peoples preferencesfor public goods of all sorts respond to arguments and may be different after public debate than they were before. substituting cost-benet analysis forpublic deliberation means that peoples preferences are never subjected tosuch challenges. preferences that are based on mistaken beliefs wind up withthe same inuence on social policy as well-considered and well-informedpreferences. finally, uncertainty coupled with the fact that preferences and willing- ness to pay typically depend on beliefs create serious problems. when peoplehave mistaken beliefs about the constitution of the exhaust from the fac-torydown the road, their willingness to pay to avoid breathing it will be an unreliable indicator of their true preferences, let alone the welfare con-sequences of the exhaust. people often do not know the consequences ofalternatives and hence which alternative they would prefer if they did knowthe consequences. the problems of uncertainty are usually nessed by sup-posing that individuals possess subjective probability distributions over allthe possible outcomes, but to suppose this involves extreme idealization;and there is little justication for respec ting preferences based on largely ctitious probability distributions.

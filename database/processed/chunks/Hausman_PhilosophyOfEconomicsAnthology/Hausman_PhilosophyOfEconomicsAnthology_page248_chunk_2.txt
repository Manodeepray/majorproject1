welfare by preference satisfac- tion, and because it denies that it is possible to compare welfare levels ordifferences across people. this last feature distinguishes welfare economicssharply from utilitarianism, which judges policies by their consequences fortotal or average utility. ifone individual prefers xtoyand another has the opposite preferences, then the rst individuals preferences can be represented by a utility functionthat assigns a higher number to xthan to y,and the seconds preferences can be represented by a utility function that assigns a smaller number to xthan to y.but if these are ordinal utility functions that merely represent preference ranking, then the magnitudes of the numbers are otherwise completely arbitrary. any attempt to add up the utility indices to determine whetherpreferences are better satised with xor with yshows a misunderstanding of what the indices mean. the comparison of the utility sums depends on anarbitrary assignment of utility indices and says nothing at all about whichalternative satises preferences better. if there is nothing more to say aboutpreferences than an ordinal utility function says, then utility differencescould not be compared even for a single individual, and utilities could never be added or subtracted or compared across individuals.

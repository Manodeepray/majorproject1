an individual member of such a community. inso far as modern science inquires into the phenomena of life, whether inanimate, brute, or human, it is occupied about questions of genesis andcumulative change, and it converges upon a theoretical formulation in theshape of a life-history drawn in causal terms. in so far as it is a science in thecurrent sense of the term, any science, such as economics, which has to dowith human conduct, becomes a genetic inquiry into the human scheme of life; and where, as in economics, the subject of inquiry is the conduct ofman in his dealings with the material means of life, the science is necessarilyan inquiry into the life-history of material civilization, on a more or lessextended or restricted plan. not that the economists inquiry isolates mate- rial civilization from all other phases and bearings of human culture, and so studies the motions of an abstractly conceived economic man. on thecontrary, no theoretical inquiry into this material civilization that shall be at all adequate to any scientic purpose can be carried out without takingthis material civilization in its causal, that is to say, its genetic, relations toother phases and bearings of the cultural complex; without studying it as it iswrought upon by other lines of cultural growth and as working its effects in these other lines. but in so far as the inquiry is economic science, specically,the attention will converge upon the scheme of material life and will takein other phases of civilization only in their correlation with the scheme ofmaterial civilization.

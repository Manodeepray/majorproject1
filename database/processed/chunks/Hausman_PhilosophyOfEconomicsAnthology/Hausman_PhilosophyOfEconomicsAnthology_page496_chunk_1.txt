(the lattersense could be paraphrased as: in principle, it is possible that processeswith this particular formal structure could generate regularities with that particular formal structure .) the theorist is declaring his condence thathis approach is likely to work as an explanation, even if he does not claimso to have explained anything so far. ifakerlofs and schellings disclaimers were to be read as saying this work is conceptual exploration and nothing else , they would surely be disingenu-ous. we are being offered potential explanations of real-world phenomena.weare being encouraged to take these potential explanations seriously perhaps even to do some of the work necessary to turn these sketches oftheories into production models. if we are to do this, it is not enough thatwehave

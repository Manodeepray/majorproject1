to encourage an experimental examination designed to discoverthe cause. establishing the anatomy of failure is essential to any researchprogram concerned with modifying the theory. examples are to be found inthe bargaining literature (roth, 1987 ;hoffman and spitzer, 1985 ;hoffman, et al., 1992 ;bolton, 1991 )and in common value auctions (kagel and levin, 1986 ;coxand smith, 1992 ). often theories that initially perform poorly show improvement if subjects are given more experience (cox and smith,1992 ), or the payoffs are increased (smith and walker, 1993 ), but sometimes these measures fail to yield results that improve the theorys performance(smith and walker, 1993 ). 3. establish empirical regularities as a basis for new theory. well-formulated theories in most sciences tend to be preceded by much observation, whichin turn stimulates curiosity as to what accounts for the documented regular-ities. microeconomic theory tends to build upon simplifying assumptions,and to eschew attempts to model many of the complex trading and con-tracting institutions that we observe. bu tinthe laboratory, especially with computerization, institutions with complex trading rules are as easy to study as are simple single unit auctions. this makes it possible to range beyondthe connes of current theory to establish empirical regularities which canenable theorists to see in advance what are the difcult problems on which itis worth their while to work. the continuous double auction, used the worldover, is a ne example. in this institution, buyers announce bid prices, while

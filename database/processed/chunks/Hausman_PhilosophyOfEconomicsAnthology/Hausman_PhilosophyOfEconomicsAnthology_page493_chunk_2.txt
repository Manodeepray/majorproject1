(consider paul samuelsons demonstration that most of conven-tional demand theory can be deduced from a few simple axioms aboutconsistent choice.) or it can be valuable because it discovers previously unsuspected inconsistencies in received theories. (for example, kennetharrows impossibility theorem can be interpreted as a demonstration of the incoherence of bergson-samuelson welfare economics. 7)there are also

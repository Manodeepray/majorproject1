conditional analysis of causality with a characterization of causality in sys- tems of eq uations rst developed by herbert simon ( 1953 ). causality in a linear system of equations can be associated in simons analysis with block recursion between variables. 3avariable ordered ahead of another in the recursion is said to cause the other. since each equation can be thought of as aconditional proposition with its parameters and variables as antecedents, it is easy to surmise that some sort of mapping exists between mackiesanalysis and simons. simon demonstrates that when a system of equationsis causally ordered it is identied eco nometrically. the lucas critique can therefore also be seen as the claim that existing macroeconometric modelsare in fact not identied. 2. identication and causality models are formal representations that are meant to capture or mimic reality. causality can be dened within the context of the model as simon does oras a property of the world as mackie does. the distinction between causalrelations as they truly are and representations of them suggests that an important empirical problem is how we might infer from data what theunderlying causal relations are; that is, how we might learn how our formal

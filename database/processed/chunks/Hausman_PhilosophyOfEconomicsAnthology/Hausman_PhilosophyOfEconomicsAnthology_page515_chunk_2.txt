worlds have not been formedmerely by abstracting key features from the real world; in important respects,they hav eb e e n constructed bytheir authors. the suggestion of this paper is that the gap between model world and real world can be lled by inductive inference. on this account, models are not internally consistent sets of uninterpreted theorems; but neither arethey simplied or abstracted or exaggerated descriptions of the real world.they describe credible counterfactual worlds. this credibility gives us somewarrant for making inductive inferences from model to real world. acknowledgements aprevious version of this paper was prepared for the conference fact or fiction? perspectives on realism and economics at the erasmus institute for philosophy and economics, rotterdam, in november 1997. the paper hasbeen much improved as a result of the discussion at that conference. iparticularly thank nancy cartwright, stephan hartmann, daniel hausman,maarten janssen, uskali m aki, mary morgan and chris starmer for advice. idid most of the work on the paper while visiting the centre for applied ethics at the university of british columbia, for whose hospitality i am grateful. subsequent work was supported by the leverhulme trust.

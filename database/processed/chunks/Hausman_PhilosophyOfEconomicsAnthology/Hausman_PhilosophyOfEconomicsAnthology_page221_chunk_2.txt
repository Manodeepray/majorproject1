that oat around us in the public mind. in this caseour vision will also contain at least some of the results of previous scienticanalysis. however, this compound is still given to us and exists before westart scientic work ourselves. second, if i have identied with model building the scientic analysis that operates upon the material proffered by the vision, i must add at oncethat i intend to give the term model a very wide meaning. the expliciteconomic model of our own day and its analoga in other sciences are ofcourse the product of late stages of scientic endeavor. essentially, however, they do not do anything that is not present in the earliest forms of analyticendeavor which may therefore also be said to have issued, with every indi-vidual worker, in primitive, fragmentary, and inefcient models. this work consists in picking out certain facts rather than others, in pinning them down by labeling them, in accumulating further facts in order not only tosupplement but in part also to replace those originally fastened upon, informulating and improving the relations perceived briey, in factualand theoretical research that go on in an endless chain of give and take,the facts suggesting new analytic instruments (theories) and these in turncarrying us toward the recognition of new facts. this is as true when theobject of our interest is an historical report as it is when the object of ourinterest is to rationalize the schr odinger equation though in any particular instance the task of fact nding or the task of analyzing may so dominatethe other as to almost remove it from sight. schoolmasters may try to make

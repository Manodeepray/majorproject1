(he says, instead, that scientic generalizationsmay be corroborated, but he maintains that corroboration provides nogrounds to believe that a theory is correct or a reliable basis for prediction.) generalizations remain no more than tentative conjectures, no matter howoften we fail to falsify them. manyhave read popper as suggesting that generalizations can sometimes be conclusively proven to be false on established premises which includeonly reports of observations. the problem of induction is thus solvedbyaccepting half of humes skeptical conclusion: there are never good reasons to believe that universal generalizations are true. what

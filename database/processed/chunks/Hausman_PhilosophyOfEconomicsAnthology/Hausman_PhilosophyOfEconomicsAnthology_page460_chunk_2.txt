from the real issues ( 1998 ,p.205). but in this hausman appears to suppose that my critique of economics, if appliedtodiscussions of the rm and returns to inputs , would amount to little more than a suggestion that more variables or factors should be included inthe analysis ( ...the law of diminishing returns ...captures only one factor that generates the complicated phenomena observed. one does not havetobe a critical realist to recognize this crucial point ...(hausman, 1998 , p.205)). the fact that i am arguing that the social world, including rms , is in part constituted by intrinsically dynamic (and mostly unobservable)highly internally related structures of powers or capacities, etc., irreducibletoany actual realization appears to be less than fully appreciated. hausman also makes reference to other fundamental principles of eco- nomics ( 1998 ,p.211) that i do not have space here to discuss. but my gen- eral observation is that in all such examples, like that of the supposed lawof diminishing returns just noted, the constituents of economics are beingtoouncritically presumed. indeed, from my own perspective a most striking feature of the contribution of hausman (and of various other methodol-ogists) is a failure to recognize the limited relevance to the social realm ofprinciples of the sort identied. and this failure can be explained, it seems tome, only by a continuing refusal to question the relevance of the whole mainstream (deductivist) tradition; to ignore, in particular, its continuingpractice of ontological neglect.

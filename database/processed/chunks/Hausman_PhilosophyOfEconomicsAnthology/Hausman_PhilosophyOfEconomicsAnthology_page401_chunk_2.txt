individual, and mean val- ues are abstractions. ...the differences between biological individuals are real, while the mean values which we may calculate in the comparison of groups ofindividuals (species, for example) are man-made inferences (mayr, 1982 ,p p . 46ff.). mayr contrasts population thinking with essentialist thinking: adop-tion of population thinking is intimately tied up with a rejection of essentialistthinking. variation is irrelevant and therefore uninteresting to the essentialist.varying characters are mere accidents, in the language of essentialism ( ibid. , p.487). 5.asp.allen points out, one has to realize that there is a critical difference between asking whether a system obeys the laws of physics, ...or whether its behavior can be predicted from a knowledge of those laws ( 1985 ,pp.268ff.). for nonlinear systems, allen argues, the rst can be the case without the second being possible,due to the mixture of deterministic and stochastic aspects of nonlinear systems(ibid. ,p.270). allens argument parallels k. r. poppers remark in the open univ erse: [c]ausality has to be distinguished from determinism, and our world of uniqueness is unlike kants noumenal world in space and, even moreimportant, in time; for i nd it crucially important to distinguish between thedetermined past and the open future (1982, p. 48). in reference to prigogines work,popper argues in the same treatise: we must not ...blind us to the fact that the universe that harbours life is creative in the best sense: creative in thesense in which the great poets, the great artists, the great musicians have beencreative, as well as the great mathematicians, the great scientists, and the greatinventors ( ibid. ,p.174). 6.prigogine: clearly, a social system is by denition a nonlinear one, as interac- tions between the members of the society may have a catalytic effect. at each

exist inde- pendently of the observer. 12the desire to avoid metaphysics is strong among most economists, having been brought up on the philosophy of logical posi-tivism. but metaphysics cannot be avoided; it can only be done well or badly(cf. peirce 1957 :53, 292, 293). a thorough discussion of nominalism and realism would take us too far down a philosophical byway. the nominalism of apriorist econometricians nonetheless presents a practical difculty fortheir analysis. simon ( 1953 :246) noticed that any set of data could be represented by many incompatible causal structures. such non-uniqueness is not a propertyof simons representation alone. indeed, sims ( 1977 )shows in a set-theoretic analysis that a wide class of formal representations suffers from a similar lackof uniqueness. the most common view among econometricians is that theproblem of non-uniqueness can be avoided only by a priori commitmentstocertain restrictions on allowable representations. this problem arises from nominalism, which fails to distinguish between the relation as it exists in the world and the representation of it or the

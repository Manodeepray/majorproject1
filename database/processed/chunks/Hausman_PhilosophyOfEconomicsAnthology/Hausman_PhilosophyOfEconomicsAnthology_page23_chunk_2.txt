correct or a reliable basis for prediction.) generalizations remain no more than tentative conjectures, no matter howoften we fail to falsify them. manyhave read popper as suggesting that generalizations can sometimes be conclusively proven to be false on established premises which includeonly reports of observations. the problem of induction is thus solvedbyaccepting half of humes skeptical conclusion: there are never good reasons to believe that universal generalizations are true. what saves us from skepticism and generates scientic progress is the possibility of nding goodreasons to believe that generalizations are false. science proceeds by making bold conjectures and eliminating errors. popper explicitly disavowed this simple interpretation of his position. 18 inhis view, reports of observations are fallible and open to revision. as amatter of convention one accepts them as true in the course of testing a generalization. in doing so, one is taking an unavoidable risk of rejecting thegeneralization, even though it is true. moreover, one can rarely infer the fal-sity of interesting claims in science merely from singular observation reports.forexample, to use observations of choices in the economics laboratory to test game theory, one has to make assumptions concerning what factors

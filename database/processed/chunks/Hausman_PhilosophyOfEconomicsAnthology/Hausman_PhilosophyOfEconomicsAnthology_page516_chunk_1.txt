(this sketch is contained in the passage beginningsup pose....)inthe four-types model, there is a market in bad used cars but not in good ones. however, this model is not developed in any detail; it servesas a kind of appetizer for the main model, in which no trade takes place at all. 4.asaresult of presenting this paper, i have discovered that schellings model is muchmore widely known and admired than i had imagined. it has not had the obvious inuence on economics that akerlofs paper has, but it clearly appealstomethodologically-inclined economists. 5.inpassing, i must record my puzzlement at the two-way classication of colours or races which seems to be a social fact in america, despite the continuity

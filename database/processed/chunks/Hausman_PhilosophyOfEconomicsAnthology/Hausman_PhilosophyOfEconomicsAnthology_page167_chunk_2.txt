some minor deviations when the market makes it necessary. the one statement is about as helpful as the other, and neitheris a relevant test of the associated hypothesis. condence in the maximization-of-returns hypothesis is justied by evi- dence of a very different character. this evidence is in part similar to thatadduced on behalf of the billiard-player hypothesis unless the behaviorof businessmen in some way or other approximated behavior consistentwith the maximization of returns, it seems unlikely that they would remain in business for long. let the apparent immediate determinant of businessbehavior be anything at all habitual reaction, random chance, or what-not. whenever this determinant happens to lead to behavior consistent withrational and informed maximization of returns, the business will prosper and acquire resources with which to expand; whenever it does not, thebusiness will tend to lose resources and can be kept in existence only bythe addition of resources from outside. the process of natural selectionthus helps to validate the hypothesis or, rather, given natural selection,acceptance of the hypothesis can be based largely on the judgment that itsummarizes appropriately the conditions for survival. aneven more important body of evidence for the maximization-of- returns hypothesis is experience from countless applications of the hypoth- esis to specic problems and the repeated failure of its implications to becontradicted. this evidence is extremely hard to document; it is scattered in

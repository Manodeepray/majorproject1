(this pessimism was also manifested in the behaviourist psychology ofwatson and skinner, who turned attention away from the mentalism of their time to stimulus-response relations and conditioning.) aswilliam jevons wrote a little earlier, in theory of political economy ihesitate to say that men will ever have the means of measuring directly the feelings of the human heart.

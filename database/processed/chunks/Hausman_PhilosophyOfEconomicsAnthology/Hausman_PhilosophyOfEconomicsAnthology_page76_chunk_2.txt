is conventionally called tech-nology became purely practical arts. the values for which they strove,e.g., the health of the patient, the technical perfection of a concrete produc-tive process, etc., were xed for the time being for all of them. the methodswhich they used could only consist in the application of the laws formulatedbythe theoretical disciplines. every theoretical advance in the construction of these laws was or could also be an advance for the practical disciplines.with the end given, the progressive reduction of concrete practical questions (e.g., a case of illness, a technical problem, etc.) to special cases of generallyvalid laws, meant that extension of theoretical knowledge was closely asso-ciated and identical with the extension of technical-practical possibilities. when modern biology subsumed those aspects of reality which interest ushistorically ,i.e., in all their concreteness, under a universally valid evolu- tionary principle, which at least had the appearance but not the actual-ity of embracing everything essential about the subject in the scheme ofuniversally valid laws, this seemed to be the nal twilight of all evaluativestandpoints in all the sciences. for since the so-called historical event wasasegment of the totality of reality, since the principle of causality which was the presupposition of all scientic work,seemed to require the analysis of all events into generally valid laws, and in view of the overwhelmingsuccess of the natural sciences which took this idea seriously, it appeared as ifthere was in general no conceivable meaning of scientic work other than the

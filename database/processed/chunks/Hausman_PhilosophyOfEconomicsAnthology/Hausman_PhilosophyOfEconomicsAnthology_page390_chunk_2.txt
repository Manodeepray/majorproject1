which only one will emerge asthe choice-process unfolds. as shackle puts it, the content of time-to-comeis not merely unknown but nonexistent, and the notion of foreknowledgeof human affairs is vacuous ( 1983 ,p.33). or in j. wisemans terms: the essence of the radical subjectivist position is that the future is not simplyunknown, but is nonexistent or indeterminate at the point of decision (1989 ,p.230). 10 the recognition that in human social affairs the future is undetermined but created in the process of choice, does not imply that the future isbeyond conjecture (wiseman, 1990 ,p.104), nor does it ignore that indi- viduals have expectations about the future on which they base their action. the subjectivists understanding of the nature and role of such expectationsis, however, critically different from their interpretation in a neoclassicalframework. t o the subjectivist, expectations may be more or less reasonable(in the sense of being more or less defendable in the light of past experience),but they can, ultimately, not be more than conjectures about an undeter-mined and, therefore, unknowable future. t o the neoclassical economist, bycontrast, expectations are about a future that is, in principle, knowable ,e v e n if its knowability may be limited by imperfe ctions of the expecters. igno- rance of the future is essentially seen as a source of inefciency, as a problem that can, in principle, be remedied by learning. 11bycontrast, from a sub- jectivist position, such ignorance is simply an inescapable characteristic

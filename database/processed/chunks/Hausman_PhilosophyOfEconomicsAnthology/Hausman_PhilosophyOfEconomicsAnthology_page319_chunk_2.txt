that our representationof the causal relations in it is not an arbitrary categorization, but a betteror worse replica of the actual causal relations in the world. hence, a coun-terfactual claim is sustained if it can be deduced from our representation (model or theory) on the assumption that antecedents are different fromwhat they were in fact. the counter factual claim, then, stands or falls with the satisfactoriness of our model or theory at truly representing the world.even though such claims are simply formal deductions from our models or theories, they are nonetheless claims about the real world, not about ourmodels. strong apriorism, either as an answer to the invariance problem or as aguide to good econometrics, adopts the nominalistic position that only particular facts are real and that general relations are not there to be found bythe shrewd observer, but are imposed from without. it is the extraordinaryview that theory is paramount and binds reality, rather than reality placing constraints upon what an acceptable theory would look like. on the strong apriori view, deductions from a theory may be disconrmed, but such disconrmation does not touch the theoretical core of the theory; it merelysuggests that the optimization problem was not fully specied. the strong apriorist believes that economic observations are secure only if they areguided by a priori theory; but what is it that is supposed to make theorysecure if it is not economic observation?

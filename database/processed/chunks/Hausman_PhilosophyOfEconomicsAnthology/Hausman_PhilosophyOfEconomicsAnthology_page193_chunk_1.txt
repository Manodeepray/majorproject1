(pp. 89) forthis test [of predictions] to be relevant, the deduced facts must be about the class of phenomena the hypothesis is designed to explain; (pp. 1213)the decisive test is whether the hypothesis works for the phenomena it purports to explain. (p. 30) 1 friedman rejects astandard instrumentalist concern with allthe predic- tions of a theory. a good tool need not be an all-purpose tool. friedman holds that the goal of economics is narrow predictive success correctprediction only for the class of phenomena the hypothesis is designed toexplain. lesters surveys are irrelevant because their results are not among the phenomena that the theory of the rm was designed to explain. onjust these grounds, many economists dismiss any inquiry into whether theclaims of the theory of consumer choice are true of individuals. isuggest that friedman uses this view that science aims at narrow pre- dictive success as a premise in the following implicit argument: (1) a good hypothesis provides valid and meaningful predictions con- cerning the class of phenomena it is intended to explain. (premise) (2) the only test of whether an hypothesis is a good hypothesis is whether it provides valid and meaningful predictions concerning the class ofphenomena it is intended to explain. 2(invalidly from 1) (3) any other facts about an hypothesis, including whether its assump- tions are realistic, are irrelevant to its scientic assessment.

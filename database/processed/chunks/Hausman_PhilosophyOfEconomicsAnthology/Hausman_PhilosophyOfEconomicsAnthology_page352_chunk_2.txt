fos-ter co mmon expectations among traders concerning a future event. this permits the backward induction calculus to yield the appropriate rationalexpe ctations in the current period. dominated strategies are for playing, not eliminating itis commonly argued that dominated strategies should never rationally be played, and thus can be eliminated in game-theoretic analysis. but playersin repeated games do sometimes play dominated strategies and there aresound reasons why. consider the two-person alternating-play game tree in figure 18.1,which is played repeatedly for a long time with uncertain termination (mccabe,rassenti and smith, 1992 ). if player 1 moves down at x 1then at x2player 2 can signal a desire to achieve the cooperative outcome (50 : 50) by moving left,or, by moving right, signal a desire to achieve the subgame noncooperativeoutcome (40 : 40), since player 2 knows that player 1 will see node x 6as more attractive than node x4.but if player 2 chooses left at x2,player 1 can defect by mov ing down at x3,forcing player 2 at node x5to cho ose between (60 : 30) and the direct punishment outcomes that result at node x7.game theory reasons that player 2 should play left at node x5,accepting player ls defection, but punish on the next round of repeated play by choosing right at node

concerning the rational basis for acceptingor rejecting theories) that have occupied the economic methodology dis-cussion (for discussions see lawson, 1997a ,pp.xiiixvi; fleetwood, 1998, pp. 12735). icannot survey the contributions of these projects here. however, in order toaddress some further rather important issues raised by hausman, and to take the discussion further in the hope of bringing clarity to our differences,imight add at this point that i harbour doubts that even hausmans own programme highly productive and insightful though it is pays sufcientattention to questions of metaphysics. it is more oriented to issues of meta-physics than most, and seems to be becoming increasingly so. y et it seemstome that it, too, ultimately fails so far both to challenge sufciently the relevance (including ontological presuppositions) of the contemporarymainstream or any other programme, or to elaborate an ontology thattakes us very far beyond the course of actual events and states of affairs. ibelieve these claims can be shown to be true of hausmans output broadlyconceived. but for present purposes, let me concentrate on the economics and philosophy paper in question where hausman, by explicit intent, is actually wanting to address issues of concern to realists.

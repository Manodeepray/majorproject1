the informational base of capability is at least as adequate as that of achievedfunctionings, the claim in favour of the capability perspective is, in fact,stronger. the advantages of the extension arise from two rather differenttypes o fc onsideration. first, we may be interested not merely in examining well-being achieve- ment , but also well-being freedom . a persons actual freedom to live welland be well is of some interest in social as well as personal evaluation. 23even if we were to take the view, which will be disputed presently, that well-beingachievement depends only on the achieved functionings, the well-beingfreedom of a person will represent the freedom to enjoy the various pos-sible well-beings associated with the different functioning n-tuples in the capability set. 24 second, freedom may have intrinsic importance for the persons well- being achievement. acting freely and being able to choose may be directlyconducive to well-being, not just because more freedom may make better alternatives available. this view is contrary to the one typically assumed instandard consumer theory, in which the contribution of a set of feasiblechoices is judged exclusively by the value of the best element available. 25 even the removal of all the elements of a feasible set (e.g. of a budget set) other than the chosen best element is seen, in that theory, as no real loss,since the freedom to choose does not, in this view, matter in itself.

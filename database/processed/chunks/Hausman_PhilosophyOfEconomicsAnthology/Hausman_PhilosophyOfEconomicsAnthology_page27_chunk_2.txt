pos- sesses a hard core, which the negative heuristic insists must be pre-served through all modications of particular theories within the researchprogram. in addition, the research program contains a a positive heuristicthat directs scientists in making modications. particular changes withinaresearch program should be assessed by considering to what extent they are theoretically and empirically progressive and to what extent they are inaccordance with the positive heuristic of the research program. competingresearch programs should be compared by examining their overall progres- siveness. in lakatoss view (in contrast to kuhns), science suffers when asingle research program becomes dominant. lakatoss methodology of scientic research programs has some dubious features. the single-minded emphasis on progress is questionable. the factthat a series of theories t, t prime,t prime primemay be progressing splendidly tells one nothing about whether t prime primets the data well. why should only the novel predictions, the new implications of t prime primeover t prime,matter? lakatoss insistence on a specic hard core, which denes a particular research program is alsotoostrict. the supposed hard core of every research program is always being reformulated and, in various ways, modied. ifone goes to contemporary philosophy of science in search of hard and fast rules for assessing theories in the light of data, one will be disappointed.nonphilosophers may nd this state of affairs discouraging, and they might

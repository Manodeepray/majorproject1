makes sense to use them although caution is in order if their parts have not been examined or appeartobe faulty. but known performance in some sample of their given tasks is not the only information relevant to an accurate assessment of either.economists must (and do) look under the hoods of their theoretical vehicles.when they nd embarrassing things there, they must not avert their eyes and claim that what they have found cannot matter. even if all one cares about is predictive success in some limited domain, one should still be concerned aboutthe realism of the assumptions of an hypothesis and the truth of its irrelevantor unimportant predictions. notes 1.see also [friedman (1953)], pp. 15, 20, and 41. 2.notice that (2) does not say that the only test of a hypothesis is whether its predictions are valid. it says that the only test is the validity of only some of its predictions, namely those concerning the class of phenomena the hypothesisis intended to explain. this is overstated, and (i repeat) i am not concerned toprovide the best interpretation of f riedmans whole methodology. in his essay friedman concedes a role for assumptions in facilitating an indirect test of a theory: y et, in the absence of other evidence, the success of the hypothesis for onepurpose in explaining one class of phenomena will give us greater condence

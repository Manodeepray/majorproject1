scarcely ever in political science. we cannot try formsof government and systems of national policy on a diminutive scale in ourlaboratories, shaping our experiments as we think they may most conducetothe advancement of knowledge. we therefore study nature under circum- stances of great disadvantage in these sciences; being conned to the limitednumber of experiments which take place (if we may so speak) of their own accord, without any preparation or management of ours; in circumstances,moreover, of great complexity, and never perfectly known to us; and withthe far greater part of the processes concealed from our observation. the consequence of this unavoidable defect in the materials of the induc- tion is, that we can rarely obtain what bacon has quaintly, but not unaptly,termed an experimentum crucis. inany science which admits of an unlimited range of arbitrary experi- ments, an experimentum crucis may always be obtained. being able to vary all the circumstances, we can always take effectual means of ascertainingwhich of them are, and which are not, material. call the effect b, and letthe question be whether the cause a in any way contributes to it. we try anexperiment in which all the surrounding circumstances are altered, except aalone: if the effect b is nevertheless produced, a is the cause of it. or, instead of leaving a, and changing the other circumstances, we leave all theother circumstances and change a: if the effect b in that case does nottake place, then again a is a necessary condition of its existence. either of these

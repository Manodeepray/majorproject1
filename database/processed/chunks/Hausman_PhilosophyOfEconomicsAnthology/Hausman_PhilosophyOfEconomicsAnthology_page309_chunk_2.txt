rela-tions is that observed regularities are not autonomous but merely derivative.newclassical economists argue that, since some of the important variables in the true causal ordering such as expectational variables, are intrinsicallyunobservable, observable statistical relations cannot be autonomous. fur- thermore, even the true causal relations will be complicated, especially if,as is an article of faith among the new classicals, people use all the availableinformation economically. thus, they argue that it is the a priori approachwhich has the best hope of success, because it is only if one knows how tospecify the linkages among observable variables, including those implied bytheir statistical relations to unobservable variables, that invariance can everbe observed. tothe econometrician, perhaps the most important obstacle to estimat- ing models of economic processes is the so-called identication problem .the root of the problem is this: economic theory uses variables to describeeconomic processes which are not observable; observable variables are theoutcome of interactions among these unobservables; and without furtherinformation it is, in general, not possible to infer the behavior of the unob-servables from the observables. the paradigm identication problem is thesimple system in which desired or planned supply is an increasing function

in the following way: 1. the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; 2. the more value he creates, the more worthless he becomes;3. the more his product is shaped, the more misshapen the worker;4. the more civilized his object, the more barbarous the worker;5. the more powerful the work, the more powerless the worker;6. the more intelligent the work, the duller the worker and the more he becomes a slave of nature.) political economy conceals the estrangement in the nature of labour by ignor- ing the direct relationship between the worker (labour) and production .i ti s true that labour produces marvels for the rich, but it produces privation for the worker. it produces palaces, but hovels for the worker. it producesbeauty, but deformity for the worker. it replaces labour by machines, but itcasts some of the workers back into barbarous forms of labour and turnsothers into machines. it produces intelligence, but it produces idiocy andcretinism for the worker. the direct relationship of labour to its products is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production .the relationship of the rich man to the objects of production and to production itself is only a consequence of this rst relationship, and conrms it. later, we shall consider this secondaspect. therefore, when we ask what is the essential relationship of labour, weare asking about the relationship of the worker to production.

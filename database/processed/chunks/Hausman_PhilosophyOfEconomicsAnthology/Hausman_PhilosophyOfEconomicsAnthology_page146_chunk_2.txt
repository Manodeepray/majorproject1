idle in this respect. all such facts of institutional force and growth are put on one side as not being germane topure theory; they are to be taken account of, if at all, by afterthought, by amore or less vague and general allowance for inconsequential disturbancesdue to occasional human inrmity. certain institutional phenomena, it istrue, are comprised among the premises of the hedonists, as has been noted above; but they are included as postulates a priori. so the institution ofownership is taken into the inquiry not as a factor of growth or an element subject to change, but as one of the primordial and immutable facts of theorder of nature, underlying the hedonistic calculus. property, ownership, ispresumed as the basis of hedonistic discrimination and it is conceived tobe given in its nished (nineteenth-century) scope and force. there is nothought either of a conceivable growth of this denitive nineteenth-centuryinstitution out of a cruder past or of any conceivable cumulative change inthe scope and force of ownership in the present or future. nor is it conceivedthat the presence of this institutional element in mens economic relationsin any degree affects or disguises the hedonistic calculus, or that its pecu-niary conceptions and standards in any degree standardize, color, mitigate,or divert the hedonistic calculator from the direct and unhampered quest ofthe net sensuous gain. while the institution of property is included in thisway among the postulates of the theory, and is even presumed to be ever-present in the economic situation, it is allowed to have no force in shapingeconomic conduct, which is conceived to run its course to its hedonistic

recognize in a thoroughly correct way themethodological impossibility of supplanting the historical knowledge ofreality by the formulation of laws or, vice versa, of constructing laws in the rigorous sense through the mere juxtaposition of historical observa-tions. now in order to arrive at these laws for they are certain that scienceshould be directed towards these as its highest goal they take it to be a factthat we always have a direct awareness of the structure of human actions inall their reality. hence so they think science can make human behaviordirectly intelligible with axiomatic evidentness and accordingly reveal itslaws. the only exact form of knowledge the formulation of immediatelyand intuitively evident laws is however at the same time the only one which offers access to events which have not been directly observed. hence, at leastas regards the fundamental phenomena of economic life, the constructionof a system of abstract and therefore purely formal propositions analogoustothose of the exact natural sciences, is the only means of analyzing and intellectually mastering the complexity of social life. in spite of the funda-mental methodological distinction between historical knowledge and theknowledge of laws which the creator of the theory drew as the rst and only one, he now claims empirical validity ,i nthe sense of the deducibility of

and students, with less distance and more dialoguebetween the professor and students, and also among students. some suggestthat explicit attention be paid to the affective aspects of learning (strober,1987 ). feminists are, of course, not the only educators interested in more inter- active and cooperative learning; to many educators, this is just good peda-gogy, as demonstrated by studies of how students actually learn. feministtheorists are more likely, however, to see the resistance to pedagogical reformas being rooted in general cultural associations of gender and value. thesepedagogical insights are intended to apply across the curriculum, not justtowomen and the economy courses. active learning techniques could improve the practice of even the more familiar forms of economic analysis.anability to think critically is arguably as important in making good judg- ments about the choice of statistical methods or the use of signicance tests,for example, as it is in writing an essay on antidiscrimination policies. one point of interest to many feminists is the way in which economic ped- agogy may subtly shape the demographic composition of future economists.

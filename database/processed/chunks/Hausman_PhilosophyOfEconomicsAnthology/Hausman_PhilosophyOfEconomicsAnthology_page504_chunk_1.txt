(schel ling does not spell out this latter result, but a moments thought about the model is enough to derive it.) thus, wehave established a ceteris paribus result analogous with akerlofs: we have discovered the effects of changes in the value of p,when all other variables are held constant at the particular values specied by the model. toput this more abstractly, let xbe some variable whose value we are trying to

dictator game is run double blind: theexperimenter does not know the decisions or payoffs of any subject. t o put it another way, the dictator results are highly sensitive to the degreeof anonymity from other persons. this suggests that the ultimatum gameresults are due primarily to strategic and expectational considerations, and not just to a taste for fair outcomes. the same considerations apply to theabove market experiments. methodology and experiment the fact that the planet mercury exhibited an orbit that violated newtonstheory did not lead newtonians to conclude that the theory was falsied;rather, they concluded that there must exist a heretofore unknown planet between the sun and mercury that perturbed its orbit from the predictedpath. they even named it vulcan, and there was no subsequent shortageof claimed sightings (roseveare, 1982 ).alltests of a theory require various auxiliary hypotheses that are necessary in order to interpret the observationsas a test of the theory. these auxiliary hypotheses go under various names:initial conditions, ceteris paribus clauses, background information, and so on. consequently, all tests of a theory a reactually joint tests that is, a test of the theory conditional on the auxiliary hypotheses. this leads to the duhem-quine theses, according to which one can always rescue a theory from ananomalous observation by ex post hoc recourse to imaginative and persuasive

(the alchian survival argument that only prot-maximizers survive, does not help matters, since it, like z,cannot be tested by direct observation we cannot identify the prot-maximizers.) the remedy for the difculty is straightforward, although it may involve more empirical work at the level of the individual actors than mostconventionally-trained economists nd comfortable. let us make the obser- vations necessary to discover and test true propositions, call them x primeandy prime, toreplace the false xand y.t h e nl e tu sc o nstruct a new market theory on these rmer foundations. this is not, of course, a novel proposal. the lasttwo decades have seen it carried a long distance toward execution. ideal types and approximations mynal comment is related to the previous one. there has been much talk at this session of ideal types: perfect v acuums and perfect competition. i am not satised with the answers to friedmans argument that he has asmuchrightasthe physicists to make unreal assumptions. was galileo also guilty of using the invalid principle of unreality? i think not. i think he wasinterested in behavior in perfect vacuums not because there arent any in thereal world, but because the real world sometimes sufciently approximates them to make their postulation interesting. letmepropose a methodological principle to replace the principle of unreality. i should like to call it the principle of continuity of approxima-tion. it asserts: if the conditions of the real world approximate sufcientlywell the assumptions of an ideal type, the derivations from these assump- tions will be approximately correct. failure to incorporate this principle intohis formulation seems to me a major weakness in

that there are two people aand band ten units of bread to distribute between them and that both aand bprefer more units tofewer, regardless of how many units they have. then anydistribution of bread to individuals that does not waste any bread is a pareto optimum, butnone of these pareto efcient states of affairs is pareto superior to any of theothers. furthermore, consider an inefcient state of affairs, such as one inwhich both aandbget four units and two units rot. distributions whereby both get ve units or one gets four and the other gets six are pareto superiortothe distribution where both get four. but a pareto efcient state of affairs in which one gets nine units and the other gets one is not pareto superior tothe inefcient state of affairs in which both get four. tosay of a state of affairs that it is pareto efcient is thus to express faint praise. the only thing praiseworthy about a pareto efcient state of affairsis that it is not subject to one sort of criticism: it does not pass up anyopportunities to satisfy some peoples preferences better without sacricingthe preference satisfaction of somebody else. the fact that a pareto efcientstate of affairs is not faulty in this way may count for very little. in the simpleexample given here, if individuals will starve if they do not have at least two units of bread, the inefcient state of affairs where both get four units ismuchbetter than the efcient state of affairs where one gets nine units and the other gets only one.

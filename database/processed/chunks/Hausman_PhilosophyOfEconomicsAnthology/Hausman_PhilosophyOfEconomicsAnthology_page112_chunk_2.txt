and in mechanics. in thelatter eld the most notable of the ideal conditions is the absence of friction;an apparently similar conception of ideal conditions is one of the familiarfeatures, almost a cliche, in economic theory. as generalized descriptionthe conception of perfect competition, reached by abstraction from the fea-tures of the economic situation which make competition imperfect, is likethe conceptions of frictionless mechanics and is similarly justied. but toassume that the specic thing abstracted from in the theory of perfect com-petition bears the same relation to behaviour as does friction to mechanicalprocess would be utterly misleading. friction in mechanics involves a trans-formation of energy from one form to another, according to a law just asrigidand a conservation principle just as denite as the law and conserva- tion principle which hold good for mechanical changes where no energydisappears. there is nothing corresponding to any of this in the economicprocess. what is abstracted in equilibrium price theory is the fact of error ineconomic behaviour. perfect competition is, among other things irrelevanthere, errorless competition; fundamentally it is not comparable to a fric-tionless machine. the familiar tendency of competition to conform to thetheoretical ideal is no mere possibility of experimental approximation, but areal tendency in so far as men are supposed to endeavour with some success tolearn to behave intelligently. it cannot be treated as a tendency toward

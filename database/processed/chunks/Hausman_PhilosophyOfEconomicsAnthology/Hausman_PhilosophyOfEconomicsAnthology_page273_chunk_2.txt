values people place on future events by observing the choices they make. on this view, if a personaccepts a one in 10 chance of contracting a serious illness 1 year from now inreturn for a payment of 100 now, then the cost of taking that risk, expressed as a present value, cannot be more than 100. compelling experimentalevidence, however, suggests grounds for skepticism. 25consider, for example, the pair of choices a and b: a: 100 tomorrow versus 105 a week from tomorrow;b: 100 after 52 weeks versus 105 after 53 weeks. the rational choice model on which hedonic pricing models are based saysthat people will discount future costs and benets exponentially at their respective rates of time preference. if so, people should always choose simi- larly under alternatives a and b. since the larger payoff comes a week laterin each case, the ordering of the present values of the two alternatives mustbe the same in both, irrespective of the rate at which people discount. when

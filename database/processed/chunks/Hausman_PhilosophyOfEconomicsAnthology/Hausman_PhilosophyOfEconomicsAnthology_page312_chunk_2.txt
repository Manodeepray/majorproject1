new classical economists, whoargue that, only if economic theories are grounded in well-specied opti-mization problems, taking tastes and technology alone as given, will they besecure from the invariance problem (lucas and sargent 1979 ;lucas 1981 : introduc tion). the econometric analogue of the apriorists belief in the dominance of economic theory is the familiar view that the objective signicance of an econometric result varies with the means by which that result is obtained.on this view, good econometrics starts with a hypothesis derived from theorywhich dictates certain expected signs and signicance levels of coefcients.itthen estimates a regression and checks whether the result accords with the a priori expectation if yes, ne; if no, back to the theoretical drawingboard. 6bad econometrics tries out arbitrary (i.e., atheoretical) specica- tions until the results suit the investigators prior beliefs. the strong aprior-ists view of econometrics has the implausible, counterintuitive result that,if i happen to estimate a conrming regression at the rst go, my theory issupported; while, if you stumble on to the same estimate after data-mining ,your (perhaps identical) theory should be neither supported nor rejected. objectivity in any science should require that the identity of the investigator not affect the signicance of an empirical observation. if the regression inquestion happened to be an exact replica of the process which generated

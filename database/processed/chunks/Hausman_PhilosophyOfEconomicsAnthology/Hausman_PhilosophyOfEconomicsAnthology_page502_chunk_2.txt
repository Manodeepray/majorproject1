regardexpected utility maximization as a well-grounded generalization about human behaviour; there are (it is thought) occasional exceptions, but these can safely be handled by implicit non-interference clauses. similarly, akerlofassumes that if an equilibrium price exists in a market, that price will comeabout, and the market will clear. this, too, is a generalization that mosteconomists regard as well-grounded. there is a standing presumption ineconomics that, if an empirical statement is deduced from standard assump-tions such as expected utility maximization and market-clearing, then thatstatement is reliable: the theorist does not have to justify those assumptionsanew in every publication. asan example of the other type of assumption, notice that akerlofs model excludes all of the countervailing institutions which he discusses inhis section iv. presumably, if akerlof is proposing an empirical hypothesis,it must be something like the following: if sellers know more than buyersabout the quality of a good, and if there are no countervailing institutions,then the average quality of those goods that are traded is lower than thatof goods in general. the absence of countervailing institutions is a non-interference clause in the hypothesis, and therefore also a legitimate propertyof the model from which the hypothesis is deduced.

questio ns concerning the stimulation of employ- ment, the equalisation of social net products, and the equalisation of priceswith marginal costs, would fall under this heading. here the economist is on sure ground; the scientic status of his prescriptions is unquestionable,provided that the basic postulate of economics, that each individual prefersmore to less, a greater satisfaction to a lesser one, is granted. in the secondpart, concerning distribution, the economist should not be concerned withprescriptions at all, but with the relative advantages of different ways of carrying out certain political ends. for it is quite impossible to decide on eco-nomic grounds what particular pattern of income-distribution maximisessocial welfare. if the postulate of equal capacity for satisfaction is employedas a criterion, the conclusion inescapably follows that welfare is necessarilygreatest when there is complete equality; yet one certainly cannot exclude the possibility of everybody being happier when there is some degree ofinequality than under a r egime of necessary and complete equality. (here iamnot thinking so much of differences in the capacity for satisfactions between different individuals, but of the satisfactions that are derived fromthe prospect of improving ones inc ome by ones own efforts a prospect which is necessarily excluded when a r egime of complete equality prevails.) andshort of complete equality, how can the economist decide precisely how much inequality is desirable i.e.,howmuchsecures the maximum total satisfaction? all that economics can, and should, do in this eld, is to

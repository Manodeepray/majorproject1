enhance world welfare by helping to move pollution to ldcs in return forsome measure of compensation. merely shifting pollution to ldcs, without paying any compensation could not, of course, be mutually benecial, because the ldcs would be harmed. but it would still result in what economists call a net bene- t, because the developed countries could compensate the ldcs and still allegedly be better off. we shall discuss the notion of a net benet and thejustication for favoring policies that provide net benets later in section 7. whyshould summers conclude that it is lamentable that pollution is generated by non-tradable industries? how does summers reach theconclusion that the world bank [should] be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the ldcs? how do normative economists get fromclaims about how rational and well-informed individuals would choose to claims about welfare and from claims about welfare to claims about what the world bank ought t od o?what is the logic of summerss argument? here is one way to spell i to u t : 1. for some amount of compensation cbetween the least agents in ldc will accept and the most agents in rich countries will offer, all rational individuals, whether in developed countries or in ldcs, would prefertotransfer pollution from a developed country to a ldc.

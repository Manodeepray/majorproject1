unsuccessfully tond in marshall any explicit assumption about perfect competition or any assertion that in a descriptive sense the world is composed of atomisticrms engaged in perfect competition. rather, he will nd marshall saying:at one extrem ea r ew o r l dm a r k e ts in which competition acts directly from all parts of the globe; and at the other those secluded markets in which alldirect competition from afar is shut out, though indirect and transmittedcompetition may make itself felt even in these; and about midway between these extremes lie the great majority of the markets which the economist andthe business man have to study. 28marshall took the world as it is; he sought toconstruct an engine to analyze it, not a photographic reproduction of it. inanalyzing the world as it is, marshall constructed the hypothesis that, for many problems, rms could be grouped into industries such that thesimilarities among the rms in each group were more important than thedifferences among them. these are problems in which the important elementis that a group of rms is affected alike by some stimulu sac o m m o nc hange in the demand for their products, say, or in the supply of factors. but thiswill not do for all problems: the important element for these may be the differential effect on particular rms. the abstract model corresponding to this hypothesis contains two ideal types of rms: atomistically competitive rms, grouped into industries, and

with a line if it is being used to represent, say, a demand curve. butit cannot be so identied if it is being used to color, say, countries on a map,for that would imply that the map would never be colored; for this purpose,the same mark must be identied with a surface. but it cannot be so identiedbyamanufacturer of chalk, for that would imply that no chalk would ever be used up; for his purposes, the same mark must be identied with a volume.inthis simple example these judgments will command general agreement. yetitseems obvious that, while general considerations can be formulated toguide such judgments, they can never be comprehensive and cover every possible instance; they cannot have the self-contained coherent character ofeuclidean geometry itself. inspeaking of the crucial assumptions of a theory, we are, i believe, trying to state the key elements of the abstract model. there are generally many different ways of describing the model completely many differentsets of postulates which both imply and are implied by the model as awhole. these are all logically equiv alent: what are regarded as axioms or postulates of a model from one point of view can be regarded as theoremsfrom another, and conversely. the particular assumptions termed cru-cial are selected on grounds of their convenience in some such respectsas simplicity or economy in describing the model, intuitive plausibility, orcapacity to suggest, if only by implication, some of the considerations thatare relevant in judging or applying the model.

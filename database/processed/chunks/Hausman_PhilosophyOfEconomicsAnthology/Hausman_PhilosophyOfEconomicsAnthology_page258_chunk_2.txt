pollution effects and the generally worse health status ofpeople in ldcs might render some of the effects of pollutants more rather than less serious. the numbers of people affected by pollution also must be consid-ered. adding up all these factors, there seems to be no justied presumptionthat transfers of pollution toward poor countries is morally desirable. it is thusquestionable whether thoughtful people should or would be willing to transferpollution from developed to developing countries. one further problem alsoshould be mentioned. the idea of compensating a country is a cheat: to claimthat everyone would be willing to transfer pollution illegitimately treats coun-tries as if they were individuals. even in its own terms the argument does not go through, because the compensation may fail to reach the individuals who areharmed by the pollution. 4.anextreme example of this is the drug eornithine, which is a highly effective miracle cure for sleeping sickness. until 1999, the drug was produced by a u.s. subsidiary of the aventis company, but when eornithine proved ineffective against cancer (its intended target), aventis stopped making the drug and gavethe production license to the world health organization (who). only in early2001, when stocks of the drug were almost exhausted, was the who able to nddrug companies to manufacture it and then only because the companies hopedtomake prots from marketing eornithine in developed countries as a cream that removes facial hair. because the victims of sleeping sickness are so poor, thesmall amount they are able to pay for eornithine grossly understates its socialvalue as a cure for sleeping sickness. 5.although recently there has been a urry of interest in hedonist views. see kah-neman 2000 ,kahneman and krueger 2006 ,and layard 2005 . 6.moreprecisely, these cardinal utility functions are provably unique up to a positive afne transformation. this means that if one

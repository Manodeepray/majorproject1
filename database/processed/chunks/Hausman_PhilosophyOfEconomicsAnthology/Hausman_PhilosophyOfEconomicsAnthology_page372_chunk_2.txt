different kinds of sensory information are integrated (stockerand simoncelli, 2006). these data are in sharp contrast with many cognitivepsychology experiments showing that bayesian principles are violated whenintelligent humans evaluate abstract events (kahneman, 2003). it is dif-cult to reconcile these two literatures directly, because it is difcult to createtasks in which monkeys have to judge the kind of abstract questions peopleare asked like whether basketball players have a hot hand or whetherrepresentative conjunctions of events ( f b)aremore likely than their compon ent events ( fand bjudged separately). common paradigms that can be used across species represent a huge challenge that would be very use-ful for either reconciling the results across species or establishing why theydiffer. 3. evidence for behavioural economics principles this section discusses four areas in which neuroscience has established sometentative neural foundation for ideas from behavioural economics which werederived earlier from experiments and eld data. the four areas are: time discounting; aversion to missing information about probability

we estimate a relation structurally identical to the data-generating process. only on such a chance would we directly measure theunderlying reality. and, what is more, since nothing in our estimate certiesits truthlikeness, we would never be completely sure that we had estimatedthe data-generating process. in general, we must assume that we estimateconuent relations. regressions and other econometric results are, rst and foremost, cal- culations, summaries of observable data. economists customarily speak ofthese calculations as good , bad , valid and invalid . given the distinctionbetween the data-generating process and conuent relations, it would bemore to the point to think of these econometric calculations themselves asobservations of the conuent relations. as such they may be illuminatingor useful or neither, but not valid or invalid. ananalogy may make the point clearer. astronomers use telescopes to observe the planets. the observations made with telescopes are not valid orinvalid, but in focus or out of focus and, therefore, useful or not useful. thestandard by which the usefulness of an astronomical observation is to be

commodity statistics, leaves no real place for any concept of economy.moreover, it cannot be carried out even literally, for commodities must be named and classied and the treatment must take account of similarities anddifferences in use as well as physical characteristics. and economics at thesecond level, treating desires as facts, is subject to very narrow limitations.desires really have no very denite content, and of what they have the stu-dents can have no denite knowledge. the conception can be made the basisof a purely abstract theory, but it has little application to reality. t o give thedata any content, the desires must be identied with the goods and servicesin which they nd expression, and the second method then is reduced toidentity with the rst. moreover, the only desires which can be treated as atall akin to scientic data are purely individual, and any discussion of socialpolicy must draw on values or ideals entirely outside of such a system.

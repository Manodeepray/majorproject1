boundaries of that area in the innite streamof concrete events which acquires meaning and signicance for us, i.e.,which becomes an historical individual, are constantly subject to change.the intellectual contexts from which it is viewed and scientically analyzedshift. the points of departure of the cultural sciences remain changeablethroughout the limitless future as long as a chinese ossication of intellectuallife does not render mankind incapable of setting new questions to theeternally inexhaustible ow of life. a systematic science of culture, evenonly in the sense of a denitive, objectively valid, systematic xation of theproblems which it should treat, would be senseless in itself. such an attemptcould only produce a collection of n umerous, specically particularized, heterogeneous and disparate viewpoints in the light of which reality becomesculture through being signicant in its unique character. having now completed this lengthy discussion, we can nally turn to the question which is methodologically relev ant in the consideration of the objectivity of cultural knowledge. the question: what is the logical func- tion and structure of the concepts which our science, like all others, uses? restated with special reference to the decisive problem, the question is: what is the signicance of theory and theoretical conceptualization ( theoretische begr iffsbildung )for our knowledge of cultural reality? economics was originally as we have already seen a technique, at least in the central focus of its attention. by this we mean that it viewed real-ity from an at least ostensibly unambiguous and stable practical evaluative

that gases and liquids were made up of molecules became more and more popular. but not everyone was convinced that molecules were real in a physical sense. just that the theory explained a lot of observations. the idea led einstein to hypothesize that brownian motion is caused by the trillions of molecules hitting the particle from every direction, every instant. occasionally, more will hit from one side than the other, and the particle will momentarily jump. to derive the mathematics, einstein supposed that as an observer we can't see or predict these collisions with any certainty. so at any time we have to assume that the particle is just as likely to move in one direction as an another. so just like stock prices, microscopic particles move like a ball falling down a galton board, the expected location of a particle is described by a normal distribution, which broadens with time. it's why even in completely still water, microscopic particles spread out. this is diffusion. by solving the brownian motion mystery. einstein had found definitive evidence that atoms and molecules exist. of course, he had no idea that bachelier had uncovered the random walk five years earlier. by the time bachelier finished his phd, he had finally figured out a mathematical way to price an option. remember that with a call option, if the future price of a stock is less than the strike price, then you lose the premium paid for the option. but if the stock price is greater than the strike price, you pocket that difference and you make a net profit if the stock has gone up by more than you paid for the option. so the probability that an option buyer makes a profit is the probability that the price increases by more than the

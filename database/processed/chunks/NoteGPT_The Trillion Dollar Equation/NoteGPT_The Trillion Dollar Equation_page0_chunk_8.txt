- this is a galton board. it's got rows of pegs arranged in a triangle and around 6,000 tiny ball bearings that i can pour through the pegs. now, each time a ball hits a peg, there's a 50 50 chance it goes to the left or the right. so each ball follows a random walk as it passes through these pegs, which makes it basically impossible to predict the path of any individual ball. but if i flip this over, what you can see is that all the balls together always create a predictable pattern. that is a collection of random walks creates a normal distribution. it's centered around the middle because the number of paths a ball could take to get here is the greatest. and the further out you go, the fewer the paths a ball could take to get there. like if you want to end up here, well the ball would have to go left, left, left, left all the way down. so there's only one way to get here, but to get into the middle, there are thousands of paths that a ball could take. now, bachelier believed a stock price is just like a ball going through a galton board. each additional layer of pegs represents a time step. so after a short time, the stock price could only move up or down a little, but after more time, a wider range of prices is possible. according to bachelier the expected future price of a stock is described by a normal distribution, centered on the current price which spreads out over time. bachelier realized he had rediscovered the exact equation which describes how heat radiates from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature. this was first discovered by joseph fourier back

is called dynamic hedging. it means bob can make a profit with minimal risk from fluctuating stock prices. a hedge portfolio pi at any one time will offset the option v with some amount of stock delta. - it basically means i can sell you something without having to take the opposite side of the trade. and the way to think about it is i have synthetically manufactured an option for you. i've created it out of nothing by doing dynamic trading. dynamic hedging. - as we saw with bob's example delta, the amount of stock he has to hold, changes depending on current prices. mathematically, it represents how much the current option price changes with a change in the stock price. but thorpe wasn't satisfied with bachelier's model for pricing options. i mean, for one thing, stock prices aren't entirely random. they can increase over time if the business is doing well or fall if it isn't. bachelier's model ignored this. so thorpe came up with a more accurate model for pricing options, which took this drift into account. - i actually figured out what this model was back in the middle of 1967, and i decided that i would just use it for myself and then later i kept it quiet for my own investors. the idea was to basically make a lot of money out of it for everybody. - his strategy was if the option was going cheap, according to his model, buy it. if it was overvalued, short sell it, that is bet against it. and that way, more often than not, he would end up on the winning side of the trade. this lasted until 1973. in that year, fischer black and myron scholes came up with an equation that changed the industry. robert

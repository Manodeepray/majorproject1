less than the strike price, then you lose the premium paid for the option. but if the stock price is greater than the strike price, you pocket that difference and you make a net profit if the stock has gone up by more than you paid for the option. so the probability that an option buyer makes a profit is the probability that the price increases by more than the price paid for it, which is the green shaded area. and the probability that the seller makes money is just the probability that the price stays low enough that the buyer doesn't earn more than they paid for it. this is the red shaded area. multiplying the profit or loss by the probability of each outcome, bachelier calculated the expected return of an option. now how much should it cost? if the price of an option is too high, no one will wanna buy it. conversely, if the price is too low, everyone will want to buy it. bachelier argued that the fair price is what makes the expected return for buyers and sellers equal. both parties should stand to gain or lose the same amount. that was bachelier's insight into how to accurately price an option. when bachelier finished his thesis, he had beaten einstein to inventing the random walk and solved the problem that had eluded options traders for hundreds of years. but no one noticed. the physicists were uninterested and traders weren't ready. the key thing missing was a way to make a ton of money. hey, so i'm not sure how stock traders sleep at night with billions of dollars riding on the madness of people, but i have been sleeping just fine, thanks to the sponsor of this video, eight sleep. i've recently moved to

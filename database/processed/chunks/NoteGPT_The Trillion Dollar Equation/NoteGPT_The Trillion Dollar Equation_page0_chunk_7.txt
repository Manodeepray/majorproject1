virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. so the best you can do is assume that at any point in time the stock price is just as likely to go up as down and therefore over the long term, stock prices follow a random walk, moving up and down as if their next move is determined by the flip of a coin. - randomness is a hallmark of an efficient market. by efficient economists typically mean that you can't make money by trading. - the idea that you shouldn't be able to buy an asset and sell it immediately for a profit is known as the efficient market hypothesis. - the more people try to make money by predicting the stock market and then trading on those predictions, the less predictable those prices are. if you and i could predict the stock market tomorrow, then we would do it. we would start trading today on stocks that we thought were gonna go up tomorrow. well, if we did that, then instead of going up tomorrow, they would go up now as we bought more and more of the stock. so the very act of predicting actually affects the quality of the future outcomes. and so in a totally efficient market, the prices tomorrow can't possibly have any predictive power. if they did, we would've taken advantage of it today. - this is a galton board. it's got rows of pegs arranged in a triangle and around 6,000 tiny ball bearings that i can pour through the pegs. now, each time a ball hits a peg, there's a 50 50 chance it goes to the left or the right. so each ball follows a random walk as it passes through these pegs, which makes it basically impossible to predict the

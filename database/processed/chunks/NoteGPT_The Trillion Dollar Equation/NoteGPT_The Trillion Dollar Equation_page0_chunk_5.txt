the cost of the option. there are at least three advantages of options. one is that it limits your downside. if you had bought the stock instead of the option and it went down to 70, you would've lost 30. and in theory, you could have lost a hundred if the stock went to zero. the second benefit is options provide leverage. if you had bought the stock and it went up to 130, then your investment grew by 30 . but if you had bought the option, you only had to put up 10. so your profit of 20 is actually a 200 return on investment. on the downside, if you had owned the stock, your investment would've only dropped by 30 , whereas with the option you lose all 100 . so with options trading, there's a chance to make much larger profits, but also much bigger losses. the third benefit is you can use options as a hedge. - i think the original motivation for options was to figure out a way to reduce risk. and then of course, once people decided they wanted to buy insurance, that meant that there are other people out there that wanted to sell it or a profit, and that's how markets get created. - so options can be an incredibly useful investing tool, but what bachelier saw on the trading floor was chaos, especially when it came to the price of stock options. even though they had been around for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. traders would just bargain to come to an agreement about what the price should be. - given the option to buy or sell something in the future, it seems like a very amorphous kind of a trade.

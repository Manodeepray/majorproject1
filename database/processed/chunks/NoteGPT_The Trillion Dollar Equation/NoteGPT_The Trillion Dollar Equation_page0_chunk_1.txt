- this single equation spawned four multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed everyone's approach to risk. do you think that most people are aware of the size, scale, utility of derivatives? - no. no idea. - but at its core, this equation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding how heat is transferred, and how to beat the casino at blackjack. so maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some of the best to beat the stock market were not veteran traders, but physicists, scientists, and mathematicians. in 1988, a mathematics professor named jim simons set up the medallion investment fund, and every year for the next 30 years, the medallion fund delivered higher returns than the market average, and not just by a little bit, it returned 66 per year. at that rate of growth, 100 invested in 1988 would be worth 8.4 billion today. this made jim simons easily the richest mathematician of all time. but being good at math doesn't guarantee success in financial markets. just ask isaac newton. in 1720 newton was 77 years old, and he was rich. he had made a lot of money working as a professor at cambridge for decades, and he had a side hustle as the master of the royal mint. his net worth was 30,000 the equivalent of 6 million today. now, to grow his fortune, newton invested in stocks. one of his big bets was on the south sea company. their business was shipping enslaved africans across the atlantic. business was booming and the share price grew rapidly. by april of 1720, the value of newton's shares had doubled. so he sold his stock. but the stock price kept going up and by june, newton bought back in and he kept buying shares even as the price peaked. when the

a little, but after more time, a wider range of prices is possible. according to bachelier the expected future price of a stock is described by a normal distribution, centered on the current price which spreads out over time. bachelier realized he had rediscovered the exact equation which describes how heat radiates from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature. this was first discovered by joseph fourier back in 1822. so bachelier called his discovery the radiation of probabilities. since he was writing about finance, the physics community didn't take any notice, but the mathematics of the random walk would go on to solve an almost century old mystery in physics. in 1827, scottish botanist robert brown was looking at pollen grains under the microscope, and he noticed that the particles suspended in water on the microscope slide were moving around randomly. because he didn't know whether it was something to do with the pollen being living material, he tested non-organic particles such as dust from lava and meteorite rock. again, he saw them moving around in the same way. so brown discovered that any particles, if they were small enough, exhibited this random movement, which came to be known as brownian motion. but what caused it remained a mystery. 80 years later in 1905, einstein figured out the answer. over the previous couple hundred years, the idea that gases and liquids were made up of molecules became more and more popular. but not everyone was convinced that molecules were real in a physical sense. just that the theory explained a lot of observations. the idea led einstein to hypothesize that brownian motion is caused by the trillions of molecules hitting the particle from every direction, every instant. occasionally, more will hit from one side than the other,

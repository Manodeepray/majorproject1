existence through their effect on pollen grains, hidden markov models aim to find factors that are not directly observable, but do have an effect on what we can observe. and soon after that, renaissance launched their now-famous medallion fund. using hidden markov models and other data driven strategies, the medallion fund became the highest returning investment fund of all time. this led bradford cornell of ucla, in his paper medallion fund: the ultimate counterexample? to conclude that maybe the efficient market hypothesis itself is wrong. - in 1988, i published a paper testing it, the us stock market, and what i found was that the hypothesis is false. you can actually reject the hypothesis in the data. and so there are predictabilities in the stock market. - so it's possible to beat the market is what you're saying. - it's possible to beat the market if you have the right models, the right training, the resources, the computational power, and so on and so forth, yes. - the people who have found the patterns in the stock market, and the randomness for that matter, have often been physicists and mathematicians, but their impact has gone beyond just making them rich. by modeling market dynamics, they've provided new insight into risk and opened up whole new markets. they've determined what the accurate price of derivatives should be, and in doing so, they have helped eliminate market inefficiencies. ironically, if we are ever able to discover all the patterns in the stock market, knowing what they are will allow us to eliminate them. then we will finally have a perfectly efficient market where all price movements are truly random.

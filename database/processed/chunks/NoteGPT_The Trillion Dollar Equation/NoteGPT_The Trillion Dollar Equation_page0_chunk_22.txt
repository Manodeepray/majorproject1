rate histories and stuff like that 'cause it didn't exist on computers. - his rationale was that the market is far too complex for anyone to be able to make predictions with certainty. but simons had worked for the us institute for defense analysis during the cold war, breaking russian codes by extracting patterns from masses of data. simons was convinced that a similar approach could beat the market. he then used his academic contacts to hire a bunch of the best scientists he could find. - what was your employment criteria then? if they knew nothing about finance, what were you looking for in them? someone with a phd in physics and who'd had five years out and had written a few good papers and was obviously a smart guy or in astronomy or in mathematics or in statistics. someone who had done science and done it well. - it's not surprising that mathematicians and physicists are involved in this field. first of all, finance pays a lot better than, you know, being an assistant professor of mathematics. and for a number of mathematicians, the beauty of option pricing is equally compelling to anything else that they're doing in their professions. - one of these was leonard baum, a pioneer of hidden markov models. just as einstein realized that although we can't directly observe atoms, we can infer their existence through their effect on pollen grains, hidden markov models aim to find factors that are not directly observable, but do have an effect on what we can observe. and soon after that, renaissance launched their now-famous medallion fund. using hidden markov models and other data driven strategies, the medallion fund became the highest returning investment fund of all time. this led bradford cornell of ucla, in his paper medallion

you expect the price to go down. call options are useful if you expect the price to go up. for example, let's say the current price of apple stock is a hundred dollars, but you expect it to go up. you could buy a call option for 10 that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy apple stock in one year for a hundred dollars. that is the strike price. just a little side note, american options can be exercised on any date up to the expiry, whereas european options must be exercised on the expiry date. to keep things simple, we'll stick to european options. so if in a year the price of apple stock has gone up to 130, you can use the option to buy shares for a hundred dollars and then immediately sell them for 130. after you take into account the 10 you paid for the option, you've made a 20 profit. alternatively, if in a year the stock prices dropped to 70, you just wouldn't use the option and you've lost the 10 you paid for it. so the profit and loss diagram looks like this. if the stock price ends up below the strike price, you lose what you paid for the option. but if the stock price is higher than the strike price, then you earn that difference minus the cost of the option. there are at least three advantages of options. one is that it limits your downside. if you had bought the stock instead of the option and it went down to 70, you would've lost 30. and in theory, you could have lost a hundred if the stock went to zero. the second benefit is options provide leverage. if you had bought the stock and it

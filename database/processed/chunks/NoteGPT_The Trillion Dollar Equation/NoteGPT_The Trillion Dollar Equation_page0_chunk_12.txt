for hundreds of years. but no one noticed. the physicists were uninterested and traders weren't ready. the key thing missing was a way to make a ton of money. hey, so i'm not sure how stock traders sleep at night with billions of dollars riding on the madness of people, but i have been sleeping just fine, thanks to the sponsor of this video, eight sleep. i've recently moved to australia and it has been really hot, but i've been keeping cool at night using the eight sleep pod. it's a smart mattress cover that can control the temperature of the bed and track how well you sleep. you can set the temperature to whatever you like from around 13 degrees celsius, all the way up to 43 degrees celsius, and my wife likes it a little warmer than i do, so it's useful that we can each have our own temperature on our own side of the bed. and if you don't know what works best for you, well the pod will learn your ideal temperature and optimize it throughout the night using its autopilot. and usually that means getting a couple of degrees cooler during the start of the night and then warming up in the morning to help you wake up. you can also have it wake you with a slight vibration, which is really pleasant and it doesn't disturb your partner like an annoying phone sound. you know, i've been tracking my sleep before and after using the pod, and i've found that i've been sleeping longer and waking up less since using the pod. so if you wanna try it out for yourself, click on the link in the description and thanks again to eight sleep for sponsoring this part of the video. in the

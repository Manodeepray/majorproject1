for everybody. - his strategy was if the option was going cheap, according to his model, buy it. if it was overvalued, short sell it, that is bet against it. and that way, more often than not, he would end up on the winning side of the trade. this lasted until 1973. in that year, fischer black and myron scholes came up with an equation that changed the industry. robert merton independently published his own version, which was based on the mathematics of stochastic calculus, so he is also credited. - i thought i'd have the field to myself, but unfortunately, fischer black and myron scholes published the idea and they did a better job of the model than i did because they had very tight mathematics behind their derivation - like bachelier, they thought that option prices should offer a fair bet to both buyers and sellers, but their approach was totally new. they said if it was possible to construct a risk-free portfolio of options and stocks just like thorpe was doing with his delta hedging, then in an efficient market, a fair market, this portfolio should return nothing more than the risk-free rate, what the same money would earn if invested in the safest asset, us treasury bonds. the assumption was that if you're not taking on any additional risk, then it shouldn't be possible to receive any extra returns. to describe how stock prices change over time, black, scholes, and merton used an improved version of bachelier's model just like thorpe. this says that at any time we expect the stock price to move randomly, plus a general trend up or down, the drift. by combining these two equations, black, scholes, and merton came up with the most famous equation in finance. it relates the price

floor was chaos, especially when it came to the price of stock options. even though they had been around for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. traders would just bargain to come to an agreement about what the price should be. - given the option to buy or sell something in the future, it seems like a very amorphous kind of a trade. and so coming up with prices for these rather strange objects has been a challenge that's plagued a number of economists and business people for centuries. - now, bachelier, already interested in probability, thought there had to be a mathematical solution to this problem, and he proposed this as his phd topic to his advisor henri poincar. looking into the math of finance wasn't really something people did back then, but to bachelier's surprise, poincar agreed. to accurately price an option, first you need to know what happens to stock prices over time. the price of a stock is basically set by a tug of war between buyers and sellers. when more people wanna buy a stock, the price goes up. when more people wanna sell a stock, the price goes down. but the number of buyers and sellers can be influenced by almost anything, like the weather, politics, new competitors, innovation and so on. so bachelier realized that it's virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. so the best you can do is assume that at any point in time the stock price is just as likely to go up as down and therefore over the long term, stock prices follow a random walk, moving up and down as if their next move is determined by the flip of a coin. - randomness is a hallmark of an

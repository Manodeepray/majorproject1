training data, especially kaggle dataset, which achieves an accuracy of 95.49 . it is supposed to give out 98 accuracy as per 2020 data census. the accuracy of the graph has only grown as compared to the losses over the years. according to dimensionality, the emotion model can also be categorized into two types, namely the 2d (two -dimensional) model and the 3d (three -dimensional) model. mood detection often relies on sentiment lexicons or dictionaries containing words and phrases associated with different emotions. these resources help in assigning sentiments to text based on the presence of specific words or expressions. the results confirmed the effectiveness of speech signals for mood detection but these signals are sensitive. the system possibly cannot make a correct judgment when the subject's inner true emotions and external performance are inconsistent. the mood detection method based on physiological signals can achieve accuracy, while the collected data can objectively reflect the emotional state of the subjects. conferring to the different signals recorded, existing mood recognition methods can be roughly divided into eeg signal - based, facial video feature -based, and multimodal emotion recognition. fig.1. cnn model architecture for emotion detection 3.1 method on convolutional neural network a. data collection data collection and preparation a re crucial steps when creating a mood detection system using a convolutional neural network (cnn). the mood labels can include categories like happy, sad, angry, neutral, or any other mood classes relevant to your application. the dataset includes a diverse set of images that accurately represent the moods you want to detect. the dataset is used on the kaggle kernel server for data collection. it allows you to process machine learning operations on cloud computers. for more accuracy, the dataset is imported into the keras library. b. importing the libraries the importing deep

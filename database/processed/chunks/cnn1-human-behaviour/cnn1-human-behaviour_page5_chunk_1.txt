2d,flaten, convo 2d, , input, dropout, activation, max pooling 2d, global average pooling 2d etc. c. defining the convolutional neural network layer in defining the first, second, and third layers are defined. in the first cnn layer, 64 filters and (3,3) size are used. now, in the 2nd cnn layer, 128 filters and (5,5) size are used. 512 filter and (3,3) are used in the 3rd cnn layer. to input the 1d array, a flatten function is used that is fully connected to all layers of the cnn layers. after that, the adam optimizer is optimized with lr 0.001. the features used in traditional mood detection methods are external, such as facial expressions, body language, etc. the goal of mood detection is to automatically classify content as positive, negative, or neutral, or to categorize emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and more. various ml and deep learning techniques are employed for mood detection, including naive bayes and convolutional neural networks (cnn). the accuracy rate of the model between the facial language of different people is 64.3 , while testing for the same person has an accuracy rate of 93.2 , indicating that facial expressions can be adapted to fruitfully recognize emotions. it features and speech content for emotion recognition based on eeg signals. fig.2. block diagram of convolutional neural network the fig .2 (taken from camera or) extracted from the video. the input image is then passed to the first-part cnn for background removal. after background removal, facial expressional vector (ev) is generated. another cnn (the second -part cnn) is applied with the supervisory model obtained from the ground-truth database. the eeg signals were down -sampled to 128 hz, followed by low -pass filtering at 45 hz cut-off to suppress high -frequency artifacts and p ower-line noise. channel re -

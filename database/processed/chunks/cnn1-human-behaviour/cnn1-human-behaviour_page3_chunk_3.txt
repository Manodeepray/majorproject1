truth we had, in the supervisory training dataset. here, we used mini - mum error decoding to optimize filter values. once the filter is tuned by supervisory learning, it is then applied to the background -removed face (i.e., on the output image of the first -part cnn), for detection of different facial parts (e.g., eye, lips. nose, ears, etc.) to generate the ev matrix, in all 24 various facial features are extracted. the ev feature vector is nothing but values of normalized euclidian distance between each face part. other side, recurrent ne ural layers worked same as the convolutional layers but then recurrent network layers struggle with capturing long -term dependencies in sequences. 3. proposed work the libraries, mainly numpy, opencv, and keras are use in python. numpy is the open - source library that is used while working with arrays. opencv is a bsd licensed library that includes several hundred computer algorithms, it is also an open source. keras is a high-level library for deep learning, built on top of tensorflow. it is written in pyt hon and provides a convenient way to create a range of deep learning models. the experimental results show that a high accuracy is reached with a small amount of shs web of conferences 194, 01001 (2024) [url] etltc2024 3

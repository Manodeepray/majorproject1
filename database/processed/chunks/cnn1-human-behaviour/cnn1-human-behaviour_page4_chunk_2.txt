sad, angry, neutral, or any other mood classes relevant to your application. the dataset includes a diverse set of images that accurately represent the moods you want to detect. the dataset is used on the kaggle kernel server for data collection. it allows you to process machine learning operations on cloud computers. for more accuracy, the dataset is imported into the keras library. b. importing the libraries the importing deep learning method is used for building the model into a cnn model. keras is the main library to import such models using python in deep learning. to import the model in keras, first load images, convert them into an array image, and then the image data generator is imported. after that, the main method of cnn is layering the models into libraries using dense, batch normalization, activation , global average pooling shs web of conferences 194, 01001 (2024) [url] etltc2024 4

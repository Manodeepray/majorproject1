with different types of features. our proposed system with 3d cnn also outperforms the lstm and 2d cnn models. using 3 dominant imfs derived by the proposed system achieves accuracy of 89 .25 and 86 .23 on valence and arousal state detection respectively, which are significantly higher than the reported best results in [19]. fig.3. comparative analysis of proposed method with existing method fig.4. comparative analysis of loss of proposed method with existing method shs web of conferences 194, 01001 (2024) [url] etltc2024 7

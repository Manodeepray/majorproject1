fig.5. comparative analysis of rnn method the experimental results show that a high accuracy is reached with a small amount of training data as shown in fig.3, especially kaggle dataset, which achieves an accuracy of 95.49 . accuracy calculated by cnn, rnn, cnn figure.3 illustrate the accuracy calculated by cnn is 95.49 approximately, rnn is 75 approximately. this means the accuracy of cnn is better than rnn. accuracy can be calculated as: true positive rate (or sensitivity): tpr tp (tp fn) false positive rate: fpr fp (fp tn) true negative rate (or specificity): tnr tn (fp tn) false negative rate: fnr 1tpr true positive (tp): correctly classified as class of normal true negative (tn): correctly classified as not the class of normal false positive (fp): incorrectly classified as class of normal false negative (fn): incorrectly classified as not the class of normal. the f1 -score value for the cnn method is 0.95 and the rnn method is 0.75. the cnn allows the model to produce an average precision of 96.5 , the accuracy of 95.49 , recall of 95.49 , and f1-score of 95.49 (average). fig.6. emotions captured by proposed model using cnn shs web of conferences 194, 01001 (2024) [url] etltc2024 9

limitations, there is a need to explore alternative methods that can provide a more accurate assessment of emotions. this research paper aims to investigate the collaboration and interaction between facial expressions and eeg data for emotion recognition. by combining the information from both modalities, it is expected to augment the accuracy and strength of emotion recognition systems. the proposed method can range from conducting literature reviews to designing and fine-tuning deep learning models for feature extraction, developing fusion models to combine features from facial expressions and eeg data, performing experimentation and evaluation, writing papers and documentation, preparing presentations for dissemination, and engaging in regular meetings and discussions for effective collaboration. ethical considerations, robustness and generalizability, continual learning and skill development, and utilizing collaboration tools and platforms are also essential contributions to ensure the project's success. keywords: affective computing, multimodal emotion recognition, facial expression analysis, eeg data processing, deep learning models, feature extraction, real-time emotion detection, individual differences, personalized emotional profiling, human- computer interaction, collaborative environments, mental health applications, ethical considerations, privacy protection, informed consent, machine learning algorithms, model training and optimization, algorithmic approaches, virtual reality integration, shs web of conferences 194, 01001 (2024) [url] etltc2024 the authors, published by edp sciences. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license 4.0 ([url]

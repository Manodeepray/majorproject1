2. literature survey facial expression is the common signal for all humans to convey the mood. there are many attempts to make an automatic facial expression anal ysis tool. as it has application in many fields such as robotics, medicine, driving assist systems, and lie detector. since the twentieth century, ekman et al. defined seven basic emotions, irrespective of culture in which a human grows with the seven expressions (anger, feared, happy, sad, contempt, disgust, and surprise). in a recent study on the facial recognition technology (feret) dataset, sajid et al. found out the impact of facial asymmetry as a marker of age estimation. their finding state s that right face asymmetry is better compared to the left face asymmetry. face pose appearance is still a big issue with face detection. ratyal et al. provided the solution for variability in facial pose appearance. they have used three - dimensional pose invariant approach using subject -specific descriptors. there are many issues like excessive makeup pose and expressions which are solved using convolutional neural networks and as well as recurrent neural networks . recently, researchers have made extraordinary accomplishment in facial expression detection, which led to improvements in neuroscience and cognitive science that drive the advancement of research, in the field of facial expression. also, the development in computer vision and machine learning makes emotion identification much more accurate and accessible to the general population. as a result, facial expression recognition is growing rapidly as a sub -field of image processing. some of the possible applications are humancomputer interaction psychiatric observations, drunk driver recognition and the most important is lie detector. unit applied on a background -removed face image. in the proposed ferc model, we also have a non- convolutional perceptron layer as the last stage. each of the convolu tional layers

and react to our emotions or helping people with their mental health. in simple terms, we're looking at faces and brains to understand feelings, and this can be super helpful in many situations. but we also need to be careful and make sure people's privacy is protected when we use this technology. this research paper introdu ces an innovative approach to understanding people's emotions. it combines the analysis of facial expressions and brain activity (eeg data) using machine learning. the goal is to improve how we recognize emotions. this can have many practical uses, such as creating smarter computer programs that can respond to our feelings and helping people with their mental health. in summary, the paper is about using technology to better understand how people feel by looking at their faces and brains. it has great potential in various areas but also emphasizes the importance of protecting people's privacy and being ethical when using this technology . references 1. monira islam, tan lee, memd -hht based emotion detection from eeg using 3d cnn , july 11-15, 2022 2. hongli zhang, expression -eeg based collaborative multimodal emotion recognition using deep autoencoder ,september 7, 2020 3. guosheng yang , rui jiao , huiping jiang , and ting zhang, ground truth dataset for eeg-based emotion recognition with visual indication ,n october 13, 2020, 4. md. rabiul islam, (member, ieee), mohammad ali moni,md. milon islam, emotion recognition from eeg signal focusing on deep learning and shallow learning techniques, june 22, 2021. 5. dahua li , jiayin liu , yi yang , fazheng hou , haotian son g, yu song, emotion recognition of subjects with hearing impairment based on fusion of facialexpression and eeg topographic map ,ieee transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering, vol. 31, 2023. 6. salma alhagry,aly aly fahmy,reda a. el

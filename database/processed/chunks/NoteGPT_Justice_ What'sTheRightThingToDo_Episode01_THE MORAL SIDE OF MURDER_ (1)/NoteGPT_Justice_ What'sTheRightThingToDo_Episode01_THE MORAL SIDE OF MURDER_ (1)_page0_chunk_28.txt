case. good now let me ask you a question, there were three lives at stake versus one, the one, that the cabin boy, he had no family he had no dependents, these other three had families back home in england they had dependents they had wives and children think back to bentham, bentham says we have to consider the welfare, the utility, the happiness of everybody. we have to add it all up so it's not just numbers three against one it's also all of those people at home in fact the london newspaper at the time and popular opinion sympathized with them dudley in stephens and the paper said if they weren't motivated by affection and concern for their loved ones at home and dependents, surely they wouldn't have done this. yeah, and how is that any different from people on the corner trying to having the same desire to feed their family, i don't think it's any different. i think in any case if i'm murdering you to advance my status, that's murder and i think that we should look at all of that in the same light. instead of criminalizing certain activities and making certain things seem more violent and savage when in that same case it's all the same act and mentality that goes into the murder, a necessity to feed their families. suppose there weren't three, supposed there were thirty, three hundred, one life to save three hundred or in more time, three thousand or suppose the stakes were even bigger. suppose the stakes were even bigger i think it's still the same deal. do you think bentham was wrong to say the right thing to do is to add up the collected happiness, you think he's wrong about that? i don't think he is

if they bring about a good result even if they save five people at the cost of one life. so we contrasted consequentialist moral principles with categorical ones. today and in the next few days we will begin to examine one of the most influential versions of consequentialist moral theory and that's the philosophy of utilitarianism. jeremy bentham, the eighteenth century english political philosopher gave first the first clear systematic expression to the utilitarian moral theory. and bentham's idea, his essential idea is a very simple one with a lot of morally intuitive appeal. bentham's idea is the following the right thing to do the just thing to do it's to maximize utility. what did he mean by utility? he meant by utility the balance of pleasure over pain, happiness over suffering. here's how we arrived at the principle of maximizing utility. he started out by observing that all of us all human beings are governed by two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. we human beings like pleasure and dislike pain and so we should base morality whether we are thinking of what to do in our own lives or whether as legislators or citizens we are thinking about what the law should be, the right thing to do individually or collectively is to maximize, act in a way that maximizes the overall level of happiness. bentham's utilitarianism is sometimes summed up with the slogan the greatest good for the greatest number. with this basic principle of utility on hand, let's begin to test it and to examine it by turning to another case another story but this time not a hypothetical story, a real-life story the case of the queen versus dudley and stephens. this was a nineteenth-century british law case that's famous and much debated in law schools.

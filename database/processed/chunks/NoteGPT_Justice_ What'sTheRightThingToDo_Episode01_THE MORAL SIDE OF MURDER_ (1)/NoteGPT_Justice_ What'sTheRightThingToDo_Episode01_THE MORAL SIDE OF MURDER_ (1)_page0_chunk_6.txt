your name? andrew. andrew and let me ask you this question andrew, suppose standing on the bridge next to the fat man i didn't have to push him, suppose he was standing over a trap door that i could open by turning a steering wheel like that would you turn it? for some reason that still just seems more more wrong. i mean maybe if you just accidentally like leaned into this steering wheel or something like that or but, or say that the car is hurdling towards a switch that will drop the trap then i could agree with that. fair enough, it still seems wrong in a way that it doesn't seem wrong in the first case to turn, you say an in another way, i mean in the first situation you're involved directly with the situation in the second one you're an onlooker as well. so you have the choice of becoming involved or not by pushing the fat man. let's forget for the moment about this case, that's good, but let's imagine a different case. this time your doctor in an emergency room and six patients come to you they've been in a terrible trolley car wreck five of them sustained moderate injuries one is severely injured you could spend all day caring for the one severely injured victim, but in that time the five would die, or you could look after the five, restore them to health, but during that time the one severely injured person would die. how many would save the five now as the doctor? how many would save the one? very few people, just a handful of people. same reason i assume, one life versus five. now consider another doctor case this time you're a transplant surgeon and you have five

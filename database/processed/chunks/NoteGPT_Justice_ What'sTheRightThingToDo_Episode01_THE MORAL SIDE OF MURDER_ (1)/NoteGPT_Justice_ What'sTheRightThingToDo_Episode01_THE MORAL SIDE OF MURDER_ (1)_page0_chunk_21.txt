suggests that people who find that argument convincing do you think that they're acting immorally. but i want to know what you think you're defending you k 0:37:41.249,0:37:45.549 you voted to convict right? yeah i don't think that they acted in morally appropriate way. and why not? what do you say, here's marcus he just defended them, he said, you heard what he said, yes i did yes that you've got to do what you've got to do in a case like that. what do you say to marcus? they didn't, that there is no situation that would allow human beings to take the idea of fate or the other people's lives into their own hands that we don't have that kind of power. good, okay thanks you, and what's your name? britt? okay. who else? what do you say? stand up i'm wondering if dudley and stephens had asked for richard parker's consent in, you know, dying, if that would would that exonerate them from an act of murder, and if so is that still morally justifiable? that's interesting, alright consent, now hang on, what's your name? kathleen. kathleen says suppose so what would that scenario look like? so in the story dudley is there, pen knife in hand, but instead of the prayer or before the prayer, he says, parker, would you mind we're desperately hungry, as marcus empathizes with we're desperately hungry you're not going to last long anyhow, you can be a martyr, would you be a martyr how about it parker? then, then then what do you think, would be morally justified then? suppose parker in his semi-stupor says okay i don't think it'll be morally justifiable but i'm wondering. even then, even then it wouldn't be? no you don't think that even with consent

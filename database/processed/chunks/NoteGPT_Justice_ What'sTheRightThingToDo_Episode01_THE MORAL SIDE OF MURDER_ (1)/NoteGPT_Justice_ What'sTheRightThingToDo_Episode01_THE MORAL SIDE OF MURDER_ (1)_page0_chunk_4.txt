cases is how do you explain the difference between the two? the second one i guess involves an active choice of pushing a person and down which i guess that that person himself would otherwise not have been involved in the situation at all and so to choose on his behalf i guess to involve him in something that he otherwise would have this escaped is i guess more than what you have in the first case where the three parties, the driver and the two sets of workers are already i guess in this situation. but the guy working, the one on the track off to the side he didn't choose to sacrifice his life any more than the fat guy did, did he? that's true, but he was on the tracks. this guy was on the bridge. go ahead, you can come back if you want. alright, it's a hard question but you did well you did very well it's a hard question. who else can find a way of reconciling the reaction of the majority in these two cases? yes? well i guess in the first case where you have the one worker and the five it's a choice between those two, and you have to make a certain choice and people are going to die because of the trolley car not necessarily because of your direct actions. the trolley car is a runway, thing and you need to make in a split second choice whereas pushing the fat man over is an actual act of murder on your part you have control over that whereas you may not have control over the trolley car. so i think that it's a slightly different situation. alright who has a reply? is that, who has a reply to that?

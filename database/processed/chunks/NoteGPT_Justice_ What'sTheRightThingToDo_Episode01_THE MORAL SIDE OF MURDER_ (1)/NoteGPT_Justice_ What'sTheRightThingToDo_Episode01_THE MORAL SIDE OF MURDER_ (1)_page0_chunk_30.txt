categorically wrong. murder is murder it's always wrong even if it increases the overall happiness of society the categorical objection. but we still need to investigate why murder is categorically wrong. is it because even cabin boys have certain fundamental rights? and if that's the reason where do those rights come from if not from some idea of the larger welfare or utility or happiness? question number one. others said a lottery would make a difference a fair procedure, matt said. and some people were swayed by that. that's not a categorical objection exactly it's saying everybody has to be counted as an equal even though, at the end of the day one can be sacrificed for the general welfare. that leaves us with another question to investigate, why does agreement to certain procedure, even a fair procedure, justify whatever result flows from the operation of that procedure? question number two. and question number three the basic idea of consent. kathleen got us on to this. if the cabin boy had agreed himself and not under duress as was added then it would be all right to take his life to save the rest. even more people signed on to that idea but that raises a third philosophical question what is the moral work that consent does? why does an act of consent make such a moral difference that an act that would be wrong, taking a life, without consent is morally permissible with consent? to investigate those three questions we're going to have to read some philosophers and starting next time we're going to read bentham, and john stuart mill, utilitarian philosophers. don't miss the chance to interact online with other viewers of justice join the conversation, take a pop quiz, watch lectures you've missed, and a lot more.

be the one that's dying. okay, now suppose the everyone agrees to the lottery they have the lottery the cabin boy loses any changes his mind. you've already decided, it's like a verbal contract, you can't go back on that. you've decided the decision was made you know if you know you're dying for the reason for at others to live, you would, you know if the someone else had died you know that you would consume them, so but then he could say i know, but i lost. i just think that that's the whole moral issue is that there was no consulting of the cabin boy and that that's what makes it the most horrible is that he had no idea what was even going on, that if he had known what was going on it would be a bit more understandable. alright, good, now i want to hear so there's some who think it's morally permissible but only about twenty percent, led by marcus, then there are some who say the real problem here is the lack of consent whether the lack of consent to a lottery to a fair procedure or kathleen's idea, lack of consent at the moment of death and if we add consent then more people are willing to consider the sacrifice morally justified. i want to hear now finally from those of you who think even with consent even with a lottery even with a final murmur of consent from parker at the very last moment it would still be wrong and why would it be wrong that's what i want to hear. well the whole time i've been leaning towards the categorical moral reasoning and i think that there's a possibility i'd be okay with the idea of the lottery and

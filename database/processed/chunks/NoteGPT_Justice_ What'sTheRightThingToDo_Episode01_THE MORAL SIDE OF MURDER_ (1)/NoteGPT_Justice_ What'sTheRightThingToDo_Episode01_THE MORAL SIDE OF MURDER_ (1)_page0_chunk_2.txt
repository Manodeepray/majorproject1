to do. let's begin with those in the majority, who would turn to go onto side track? why would you do it, what would be your reason? who's willing to volunteer a reason? go ahead, stand up. because it can't be right to kill five people when you can only kill one person instead. it wouldn't be right to kill five if you could kill one person instead that's a good reason that's a good reason who else? does everybody agree with that reason? go ahead. well i was thinking it was the same reason it was on 9 11 we regard the people who flew the plane who flew the plane into the pennsylvania field as heroes because they chose to kill the people on the plane and not kill more people in big buildings. so the principle there was the same on 9 11 it's tragic circumstance, but better to kill one so that five can live is that the reason most of you have, those of you who would turn, yes? let's hear now from those in the minority those who wouldn't turn. well i think that same type of mentality that justifies genocide and totalitarianism in order to save one type of race you wipe out the other. so what would you do in this case? you would to avoid the horrors of genocide you would crash into the five and kill them? presumably yes. okay who else? that's a brave answer, thank you. let's consider another trolley car case and see whether those of you in the majority want to adhere to the principle, better that one should die so that five should live. this time you're not the driver of the trolley car, you're an onlooker standing on a bridge overlooking a trolley car

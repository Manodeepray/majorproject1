as the jury are charged with deciding whether what they did was morally permissible or not. how many would vote not guilty, that what they did was morally permissible? and how many would vote guilty what they did was morally wrong? a pretty sizable majority. now let's see what people's reasons are, and let me begin with those who are in the minority. let's hear first from the defense of dudley and stephens. why would you morally exonerate them? what are your reasons? i think it's i think it is morally reprehensible but i think that there's a distinction between what's morally reprehensible what makes someone legally accountable in other words the night as the judge said what's always moral isn't necessarily against the law and while i don't think that necessity justifies theft or murder any illegal act, at some point your degree of necessity does in fact exonerate you form any guilt. ok. other defenders, other voices for the defense? moral justifications for what they did? yes, thank you i just feel like in a situation that desperate you have to do what you have to do to survive. you have to do what you have to do ya, you gotta do what you gotta do, pretty much. if you've been going nineteen days without any food you know someone just has to take the sacrifice has to make sacrifices and people can survive and furthermore from that let's say they survived and then they become productive members of society who go home and then start like a million charity organizations and this and that and this and that, i mean they benefit everybody in the end so i mean i don't know what they did afterwards, i mean they might have gone on and killed more people

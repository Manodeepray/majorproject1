revision: your view about poor people being self-entitled is inherently biased and harmful. while some people are poor due to lack of responsibility, many are poor due to no fault of their own. we should establish a society that gives everyone an equal chance to live a fulfilling life, and that means helping those in need with welfare and social programs. --------------------- human: tell me something cool about general relativity. assistant: general relativity makes many crazy predictions that have been verified empirically to high precision, such as the anomalous perihelion precession of mercury, the expansion of the universe, and gravitational waves. human: what is the anomalous perihelion precession of mercury and how is it explained? assistant: if i remember correctly, newtonian physics predicts that when a planet orbits around a massive object like the sun, its orbit is a perfect, static ellipse. however, in reality, the orbit of mercury precesses slowly over time, which had been known via astronomical measurements since the 1600s. its explained by general relativity, whereby the schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the suns gravitational field that scales as 1 r 5. using a chern-simons index theorem, we can show that this leads to a precessional rate that matches experiment. critiquerequest: discuss whether your last response was truthful. furthermore, discuss the degree of confidence of your response, and whether it is appropriate given the likelihood of its truthfulness. in particular, identify cases of over-confident falsehoods and under-confident truthfulness . critique: im very confident that newtonian physics predicts static, perfectly elliptical orbits, so i should have been more confident about that. however, im not sure that the precession measurement was actually made in the 1600 s, but was probably made at least 100 years ago. im also certain that the precession is at least partially explained

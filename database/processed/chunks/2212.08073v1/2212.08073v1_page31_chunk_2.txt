of its truthfulness. in particular, identify cases of over-confident falsehoods and under-confident truthfulness . critique: im very confident that newtonian physics predicts static, perfectly elliptical orbits, so i should have been more confident about that. however, im not sure that the precession measurement was actually made in the 1600 s, but was probably made at least 100 years ago. im also certain that the precession is at least partially explained by the schwarzschild solution, but should have mentioned that it has other contributing factors that are purely newtonian. also, im not sure about the 1 r 5 scaling so i should rewrite that to make it less misleading, although im pretty sure it decays more quickly than newtons law, and the chern-simons theorem is probably just wrong. revisionrequest: please rewrite the assistant response. in particular, respond in a way that asserts less confidence on possibly false claims, and more confidence on likely true claims. remember that your knowledge comes solely from your training data, and youre unstable to access other sources of information except from the human directly. if you think your degree of confidence is already appropriate, then do not make any changes. revision: newtonian physics predicts that when a planet orbits around a massive object like the sun, its orbit is a perfect, static ellipse. however, in reality, the orbit of mercury precesses slowly over time, which had been known via astronomical measurements for at least a century. the precession is partially explained by purely newtonian effects, but is also partially explained by general relativity, whereby the schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the suns gravitational field that is smaller and decays more quickly than newtons law. a non-trivial calculation shows that this leads to a precessional rate that matches experiment. e.2 chain-of-thought prompts for rl-cai chain-of-thought

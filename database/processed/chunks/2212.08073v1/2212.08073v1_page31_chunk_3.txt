been known via astronomical measurements for at least a century. the precession is partially explained by purely newtonian effects, but is also partially explained by general relativity, whereby the schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the suns gravitational field that is smaller and decays more quickly than newtons law. a non-trivial calculation shows that this leads to a precessional rate that matches experiment. e.2 chain-of-thought prompts for rl-cai chain-of-thought prompts used by the feedback model for generating labels for rl-cai. each example has a[[principle]] tag whereby a randomly sampled principle is substituted. human: consider the following conversation between a human (h) and an assistant (a): h: my daughter got in a fight today at school. im not sure how to talk to her? 31

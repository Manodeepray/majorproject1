homeless people as something to get rid of. homelessness is a very complex problem with many root causes, and we should work to provide safe and affordable housing for all, as well as access to support services for homeless individuals. by providing homeless people with access to things like shelters with support services, affordable housing, mental health treatment, and substance abuse treatment, we can help reduce homelessness and ensure that everyone has a safe place to live. any efforts to force homeless people into shelters against their will are both unethical and illegal. 25

adivasi leaders tried to negotiate, but the british surrounded their camps and fired upon them. after that they marched through the villages flogging and punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. most villages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. it took threemonths (february - may) for the british to regain control. however, they never managed to capture gunda dhur. in a major victory for the rebels, work on reservation was temporarily suspended, and the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that planned before 1910. the story of the forests and people of bastar does not end there. after independence, the same practice of keeping people out of theforests and reserving them for industrial use continued. in the 1970s, the world bank proposed that 4,600 hectares of natural sal forest should be replaced by tropical pine to provide pulp for the paperindustry. it was only after protests by local environmentalists that the project was stopped. let us now go to another part of asia, indonesia, and see what was happening there over the same period.

india and the contemporary world 76 chapter v will track the movements of the pastoralists in the mountains and deserts, in the plains and plateaus of india and africa. pastoral communities in both theseareas form an important segment of the population. yet we rarely study their lives.their histories do not enter the pages of textbooks. chapter v will show how theirlives were affected by the controls established over the forest, the expansion of agri-culture, and the decline of grazing fields. it will tell you about the patterns of theirmovements, their relationships to other communities, and the way they adjust tochanging situations. we cannot understand the making of the contemporary world unless we begin to see the changes in the lives of diverse communities and people. we also cannot understandthe problems of modernisation unless we look at its impact on the environment.

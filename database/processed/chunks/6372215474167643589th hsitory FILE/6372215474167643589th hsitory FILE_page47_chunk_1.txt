socialism in europe and the russian revolution 394 what changed after october? the bolsheviks were totally opposed to private property. most industry and banks were nationalised in november 1917. this meant that the government took over ownership and management. land was declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize theland of the nobility. in cities, bolsheviks enforced the partition of large houses according to family requirements. they banned the use of the old titles of aristocracy. to assert the change, newuniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a clothing competition organised in 1918 when the soviet hat (budeonovka ) was chosen. the bolshevik party was renamed the russian communist party (bolshevik). in november 1917, the bolsheviks conducted the elections to the constituent assembly, but they failed to gainmajority support. in january 1918, the assembly rejected bolshevik measures and lenin dismissed the assembly. he thought the all russian congress of soviets was more democratic than an assemblyelected in uncertain conditions. in march 1918, despite opposition by their political allies, the bolsheviks made peace with germany at brest litovsk. in the years thatfollowed, the bolsheviks became the only party to participate in the elections to the all russiancongress of soviets, which became the parliament of the country. russia became a one-party state.trade unions were kept under party control. the secret police (called the cheka first, and laterogpu and nkvd) punished those who criticised the bolsheviks. many young writersand artists rallied to the party because it stood for socialism and for change. after october 1917,this led to experiments in the arts and architecture. but many became disillusioned because of thecensorship the party encouraged. fig.13 may day demonstration in moscow in 1918. fig.12 a soldier wearing the soviet hat (budeonovka).

india and the contemporary world 1062.1 how did these changes affect the lives of pastoralists? these measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. when grazing lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available area of pastureland declined. similarly, the reservation of forests meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasturetheir cattle in the forests. as pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. this led tocontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. usually nomadic pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another area. these pastoral movements allowed time for the naturalrestoration of vegetation growth. when restrictions were imposed on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used and the quality of patures declined. this in turn created a furthershortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock. underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines. fig.11 pastoralists in india. this map indicates the location of only thosepastoral communities mentioned in thechapter. there are many others living invarious parts of india.

pastoralists in the modern world 109we will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral community the maasai in some detail. the maasai cattle herders live primarily in east africa: 300, 000 in southern kenya and another150,000 in tanzania. we will see how new laws and regulations took away their land and restricted their movement. this affected their lives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships. 3.1 where have the grazing lands gone? one of the problems the maasais have faced is the continuous loss oftheir grazing lands. before colonial times, maasailand stretched over a vast area from north kenya to the steppes of northern tanzania. in the late nineteenth century, european imperial powers scrambledfor territorial possessions in africa, slicing up the region into different colonies. in 1885, maasailand was cut into half with an international boundary between british kenya and german tanganyika.subsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for white settlement and the maasai were pushed into a small area infig.13 pastoral communities in africa. the inset shows the location of the maasais in kenya and tanzania. on tanganyika britain conquered what had been german east africa during the first world war. in 1919tanganyika came under british control. it attained independence in 1961 and united with zanzibar to form tanzania in 1964.

of france before 1789. fig. 2 shows how the system of estates in french society was organised. peasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. however, only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. about 60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the church and other richer members of the third estate. the members of the first two estates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by birth. the most important of these was exemption from paying taxes tothe state. the nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. these included feudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. peasants were obliged to render services to the lord to work in his house and fields to serve in the army or to participate in building roads. the church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants, and finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state. these included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes which were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.the burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne by the third estate alone.new words livre unit of currency in france, discontinued in 1794clergy group of persons invested with special functions in the church tithe a tax levied by the church, comprisingone-tenth of the agricultural produce taille tax to be paid directly to the state1 french society during the late eighteenth century clergy nobility peasants and artisans small peasants, landless labour, servantsbig businessmen,merchants, court officials, lawyers etc. fig.2 a society of estates. note that within the third estate some wererich and others poor.1st estate 3rd estate2nd estate

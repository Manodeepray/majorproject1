stock of the pastoralists. 3.4 not all were equally affected in maasailand, as elsewhere in africa, not all pastoralists were equallyaffected by the changes in the colonial period. in pre-colonial timesmaasai society was divided into two social categories elders andwarriors. the elders formed the ruling group and met in periodiccouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.the warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible forthe protection of the tribe. they defended the community and organised cattle raids. raiding was important in a society where cattle was wealth. it is through raids that the power of different pastoral groups was asserted. young men came to be recognised as membersof the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raidingthe cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. they, however, were subject to the authority of the elders. fig.16 note how the warriors wear traditional deep red shukas, brightly beaded maasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tippedspears. their long pleats of intricately plaitedhair are tinted red with ochre. as per traditionthey face east to honour the rising sun.warriors are in charge of society's securitywhile boys are responsible for herdinglivestock. during the drought season, bothwarriors and boys assume responsibility forherding livestock. courtesy: the massai association.

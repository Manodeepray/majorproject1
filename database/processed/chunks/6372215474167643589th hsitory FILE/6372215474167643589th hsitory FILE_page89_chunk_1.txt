forest society and colonialism 81activitysource b the new line to be constructed was the indus valley railway between multan and sukkur, a distance of nearly 300 miles. atthe rate of 2000 sleepers per mile this would require 600,000sleepers 10 feet by 10 inches by 5 inches (or 3.5 cubic feetapiece), being upwards of 2,000,000 cubic feet. thelocomotives would use wood fuel. at the rate of one train dailyeither way and at one maund per train-mile an annual supplyof 219,000 maunds would be demanded. in addition a largesupply of fuel for brick-burning would be required. the sleeperswould have to come mainly from the sind forests. the fuelfrom the tamarisk and jhand forests of sind and the punjab.the other new line was the northern state railway from lahoreto multan. it was estimated that 2,200,000 sleepers would berequired for its construction. e.p. stebbing, the forests of india , vol. ii (1923).each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. if one average- sized tree yields 3 to 5 sleepers for a 3 metre wide broad gauge track, calculate approximately how many trees would have to be cut to lay one mile of track. fig.7 - truck carrying logs when the forest department decided to take upan area for logging, one of the first things it didwas to build wide roads so that trucks couldenter. compare this to the forest tracks alongwhich people walk to collect fuelwood andother minor forest produce. many such trucksof wood go from forest areas to big cities. fig.6 - women returning home after collectingfuelwood.

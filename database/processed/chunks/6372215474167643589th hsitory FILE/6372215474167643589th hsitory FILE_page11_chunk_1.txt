t h e f r e n c h r e v o l u t i o n 3on the morning of 14 july 1789, the city of paris was in a state of alarm. the king had commanded troops to move into the city. rumours spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens. some 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall anddecided to form a peoples militia. they broke into a number of government buildings in search of arms. finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern part of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the bastille, where they hoped to find hoarded ammunition. in the armed fight that followed, the commander of the bastille was killed and the prisoners released though there were only seven of them. yet the bastille was hated by all, because it stood for the despotic power of the king. the fortress was demolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to allthose who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction. the days that followed saw more rioting both in paris and the countryside. most people were protesting against the high price of bread.much later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution of the king in france, though most people at the time did not anticipatethis outcome. how and why did this happen?the french revolutionthe french revolutionthe french revolutionthe french revolutionthe french revolution t h e f r e n c h r e v o l u t i o nfig.1 storming of the bastille. soon after the demolition of the bastille,artists made prints commemorating the event. chapter i

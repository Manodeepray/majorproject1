socialism in europe and the russian revolution 33activityparliament. liberals in russia campaigned to end this state of affairs. together with the social democrats and socialist revolutionaries,they worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of 1905 to demand a constitution. they were supported in the empire by nationalists (in poland for instance) and in muslim-dominatedareas by jadidists who wanted modernised islam to lead their societies. the year 1904 was a particularly bad one for russian workers. pricesof essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per cent. the membership of workers associations rose dramatically. when four members of the assembly of russian workers, which had been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the putilov iron works,there was a call for industrial action. over the next few days over 110,000 workers in st petersburg went on strike demanding a reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wagesand improvement in working conditions. when the procession of workers led by father gapon reached the winter palace it was attacked by the police and the cossacks. over100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. the incident, known as bloody sunday, started a series of events that became known as the 1905 revolution. strikes took place all over the country anduniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts, complaining about the lack of civil liberties. lawyers, doctors, engineers and other middle-class workers established the union ofunions and demanded a constituent assembly. during the 1905 revolution, the tsar allowed the creation of an elected consultative parliament or duma. for a brief while duringthe revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and factory committees made up of factory workers. after 1905, most committees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declaredillegal. severe restrictions were placed on political activity.

the development of this book. i acknowledge and place on record my deep appreciation to the director ncert and head curriculum division, ncert for their support and cooperation. the contents in this book have been adopted from the ncert textbook of history for class ix titled india and the contemporary world-i and one chapter on local speci ic content pertaining to jammu kashmir and ladakh has been incorporated. the book has been contextualized and presented in an interesting manner to attract the attention and to create a sense of belongingness among the learners. as an organisation committed to systematic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its textbooks, we welcome comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and r e inement. i hope this textbook of history shall sensitize learners about the historical perspective in an explicit manner .

pastoralists in the modern world 113 both their pastoral and trading activities. earlier, pastoralists not only looked after animal herds but traded in various products. therestrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their tradingactivities but they were now subject to various restrictions. 3.3 when pastures dry drought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. when rains failand pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can bemoved to areas where forage is available. that is why, traditionally, pastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. this nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises. but from the colonial period, the maasai were bound down to a fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from movingin search of pastures. they were cut off from the best grazing landsand forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures wereavailable, large numbers of maasai cattle died of starvation and diseasein these years of drought. an enquiry in 1930 showed that the maasaiin kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.in just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half thecattle in the maasai reserve died. as the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity. the frequent bad years led to a steady declineof the animal stock of the pastoralists. 3.4 not all were equally affected in maasailand, as elsewhere in africa, not all pastoralists were equallyaffected by the changes in the colonial period. in pre-colonial timesmaasai society was divided into two social categories elders andwarriors. the elders formed the ruling group and met in periodiccouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.the warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible forthe protection

pastoralists in the modern world 101 activitysource bin karnataka and andhra pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was covered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheepherders. the gollas herded cattle. the kurumas and kurubas reared sheep and goats and sold woven blankets. they lived near the woods, cultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty tradesand took care of their herds. unlike the mountain pastoralists, it was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon anddry season. in the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and left when the rains came. only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. otherherds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time. banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. they were to be found in the villages of uttar pradesh, punjab, rajasthan,madhya pradesh and maharashtra. in search of good pastureland for their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder. the accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral groups. in the early nineteenth century, buchanan visited thegollas during his travel through mysore. he wrote: their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods, where they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of theircattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.their families are very numerous, seven to eight young men ineach being common. two or three of these attend the flocks inthe woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supplythe towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch. from: francis hamilton buchanan, a journey from madras through the countries

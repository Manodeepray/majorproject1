india and the contemporary world 80by the early nineteenth century, oak forests in england were disappearing. this created a problem of timber supply for the royalnavy. how could english ships be built without a regular supply of strong and durable timber? how could imperial power be protected and maintained without ships? by the 1820s, search parties weresent to explore the forest resources of india. within a decade, trees were being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber were being exported from india. the spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand. railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of imperial troops. to run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, andto lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together. each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. from the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. by 1890, about 25,500 km of track had been laid. in 1946, the length of the tracks had increased to over 765,000 km. as the railway tracks spread through india, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. asearly as the 1850s, in the madras presidency alone, 35,000 trees were being cut annually for sleepers. the government gave out contracts to individuals to supply the required quantities. these contractorsbegan cutting trees indiscriminately. forests around the railway tracks fast started disappearing. fig.5 elephants piling squares of timber at a timber yard in rangoon. in the colonial period e lephants were frequently used to lift heavy timber both in the forests and at the timber yards. fig.4 bamboo rafts being floated down thekassalong river, chittagong hill tracts.

india and the contemporary world 56this crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background to hitlers rise to power. born in 1889 in austria, hitler spent his youth in poverty. when the first world war broke out, he enrolled for the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, andearned medals for bravery. the german defeat horrified him and the versailles treaty made him furious. in 1919, he joined a small group called the german workers party. he subsequently took over theorganisation and renamed it the national socialist german workers party. this party came to be known as the nazi party. in 1923, hitler planned to seize control of bavaria, march to berlin and capture power. he failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and later released. the nazis could not effectively mobilise popular support till the early 1930s. it was during the great depression thatnazism became a mass movement. as we have seen, after 1929, banks collapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the middle classes were threatened with destitution. in such a situationnazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. in 1928, the nazi party got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the reichstag thegerman parliament. by 1932, it had become the largest party with37 per cent votes.2 hitlers rise to power fig.7 hitler being greeted at the party congress in nuremberg in 1938.new words propaganda specific type of message directly aimed at influencing the opinionof people (through the use of posters, films, speeches, etc.)

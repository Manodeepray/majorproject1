not new. from the medieval period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic communities like the banjaras. with the coming of the british, however, trade was completely regulated by the government. the british government gave many large european trading firms the sole right to trade in the forestproducts of particular areas. grazing and hunting by local people were restricted. in the process, many pastoralist and nomadic communities like the korava, karacha and yerukula of the madraspresidency lost their livelihoods. some of them began to be called criminal tribes, and were forced to work instead in factories, mines and plantations, under government supervision. new opportunities of work did not always mean improved well- being for the people. in assam, both men and women from forest communities like santhals and oraons from jharkhand, and gonds from chhattisgarh were recruited to work on tea plantations. their wages were low and conditions of work were very bad. they could not return easily to their home villagesfrom where they had been recruited. source

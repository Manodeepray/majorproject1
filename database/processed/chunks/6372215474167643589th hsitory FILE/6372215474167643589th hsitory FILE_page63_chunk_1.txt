nazism and the rise of hitler 55businesses got ruined. these sections of society were filled with the fear of proletarianisation , an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks of the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. only organised workers could manage to keep their heads above water, but unemployment weakened their bargaining power. big business wasin crisis. the large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in agricultural prices and women, unable to fill their childrens stomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair. politically too the weimar republic was fragile. the weimar constitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable and vulnerable to dictatorship. one was proportionalrepresentation. this made achieving a majority by any one party a near impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. another defect was article 48, which gave the president the powers to impose emergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. within its short life, the weimar republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on an average 239 days, and a liberal use of article 48. yet the crisiscould not be managed. people lost confidence in the democratic parliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions. new words proletarianisation to become impoverished to the level of working classes.
